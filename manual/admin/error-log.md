# Error Log

The **Error Log** is an admin-only page that shows the latest application errors captured
across the backend — exception message, type, source, and full stacktrace — so operators can
diagnose failures without shelling into a container or wiring an external log stack.

It lives in the admin-only **Settings** hub — open **Settings** from the sidebar, then choose
**Error log** under the *Workspace* group (direct link: `/settings/error-log`). The whole
Settings area is visible only to users with the **Admin** role, and the underlying API
(`/api/error-log`) is likewise restricted to admins, because stacktraces can contain sensitive
runtime detail.

## What gets captured

Every log entry at **Error** or **Critical** severity is captured, from anywhere in the
backend — request handling, background services, the ingestion consumer, the optimizer, and so
on. This is broader than just failed HTTP requests: errors that never surface as a response are
still recorded.

Expected cancellations (client disconnect or shutdown, i.e. `OperationCanceledException` /
`TaskCanceledException`) are **not** recorded — they are normal, not faults.

Each entry stores:

- **Message** — the log/exception message.
- **Level** — `Error` or `Critical`.
- **Source** — the logger category (typically the fully-qualified type that logged it).
- **Exception type** and **Stacktrace** — present when an exception was logged.
- **Timestamp** — when the error occurred.

Errors are persisted to the database, so they survive restarts and are shared across replicas.
Entries from Entity Framework Core and the error-log pipeline itself are deliberately excluded
to avoid feedback loops.

::: tip API responses are sanitized — the Error Log is not
Outside development, an unexpected server error returns only a generic message to the client
(database conflicts surface as a friendly 409). The full exception message and stacktrace are
still captured here, so the Error Log is the place to diagnose what actually happened.
:::

::: info No file/line numbers in released containers
The official container images ship without debug symbols, so stacktraces show the full call
chain (namespaces, classes, methods) but no source file or line numbers. When reporting an
issue, include the Proxytrace version alongside the stacktrace — together they pinpoint the
location.
:::

::: tip Client-side error reports are separate
The in-app "report this error" action (`POST /api/errors`) logs a **warning**, not an error,
so client-reported issues do not appear in the Error Log.

## Using the page

- The list is newest-first and paginated. Use the **Per page** selector to change how many
  rows are shown at once, and the pager to move between pages.
- The **search box** does a case-insensitive infix match against both the **message** and the
  **stacktrace**, so you can find an error by any substring of either (typing starts filtering
  after two characters).
- The **All / Error / Critical** toggle filters by severity.
- The **time-range picker** (the clock button next to the search box) restricts the list to
  errors captured within a window. Open it to pick a relative **quick range** (Last 15
  minutes, hour, 6 hours, 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days) for a one-click filter, or enter an
  explicit **From**/**To** under *Custom range* and press **Apply** — either end may be left
  blank for an open-ended bound. Times are entered and shown in your local timezone. The
  **×** beside the button clears the filter back to *All time*.
- The **When** column shows the absolute date and time the error occurred.
- Selecting a row opens a detail panel with the full stacktrace (copyable).
- The page refetches when you return to the tab; there is no live stream.

## Automatic rotation & cleanup

A scheduled background service prunes the table automatically so it never grows unbounded:

- **Age-based rotation** — errors older than the retention window are deleted.
- **Count cap** — only the newest *N* errors are kept, bounding the table during an error storm.

Configure it under the `ErrorLogCleanup` section of `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "ErrorLogCleanup": {
    "RetentionDurationDays": 14,
    "CleanupIntervalHours": 6,
    "MaxRetained": 10000
  }
}
```

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RetentionDurationDays` | `14` | Errors older than this are removed. |
| `CleanupIntervalHours` | `6` | How often the cleanup pass runs. |
| `MaxRetained` | `10000` | Hard cap on the number of newest errors kept. |

See [Configuration](/admin/configuration) for how settings files and environment variables are
applied.
