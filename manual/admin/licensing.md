# Licensing

Proxytrace ships with a built-in licensing subsystem that gates premium features and
enforces tier limits. **You do not need a license to run Proxytrace** — it runs on the
**Free** tier out of the box.

## Source availability

Proxytrace's source code is public at
[github.com/Proxytrace/Proxytrace](https://github.com/Proxytrace/Proxytrace) under the
[Elastic License 2.0](https://github.com/Proxytrace/Proxytrace/blob/master/LICENSE) —
you can audit exactly what your deployment runs. The license does not permit offering
Proxytrace as a managed service to third parties or circumventing the license-key
functionality described on this page.

## Free by default

With no license configured, Proxytrace starts on the **Free** tier with no further
configuration. The Free tier allows:

- **1** project
- **3** users
- **1** agent
- **1** test suite
- **14-day** trace retention
- **10,000** traces per month

On startup you will see an informational log line confirming the tier, for example:

```
info: Proxytrace.Licensing.LicenseService[0]
      No license configured — running in Free tier.
```

To unlock higher limits and premium features, activate an Enterprise license key (see
[Where to buy](#where-to-buy)).

## Activating a license key

There are three ways to supply a license key; all accept the same token (a JWT):

1. **First-run setup wizard** — the Welcome step shows the active tier and offers a
   *"Have a license key?"* field. Paste the key, validate, and activate it before
   creating the first admin account.
2. **Settings → License** (admins) — paste a key, **Validate** it (a dry run that shows
   the tier, customer, and expiry it would activate), then **Activate**. The key is
   verified offline, stored in the database, and applied **immediately — no restart**.
   The same page shows the current tier, status, where the active license came from, and
   offers **Re-check now** (force a license-server check) and **Remove stored license**.
3. **`PROXYTRACE_LICENSE` environment variable** — set it in the deployment `.env` and
   restart. Useful for infrastructure-as-code setups.

### Precedence

A key activated in the UI is stored in the database and **takes precedence** over the
`PROXYTRACE_LICENSE` environment variable. Removing the stored key (Settings → License →
*Remove stored license*) falls back to the environment-supplied license, or the Free tier
when none is set.

## An invalid license never blocks startup

If a configured license fails validation — malformed, signed with an unknown key, issued
for the wrong audience, or already expired — Proxytrace **still starts**, running with
Free-tier entitlements and the license status **Invalid**. A red banner appears above the
top bar (and on the setup wizard's Welcome step) with the rejection reason and a link to
**Settings → License**, where an admin can paste a corrected key — no container restart
needed.

The log shows the reason:

```
warn: The configured license is invalid (Expired); running with Free-tier entitlements until it is corrected
```

The reason is one of `Malformed`, `BadSignature`, `WrongIssuer`, `WrongAudience`,
`Expired`, or `MissingClaim`.

::: tip
The token is trimmed before validation, so surrounding whitespace is tolerated, but
embedded newlines from a bad copy/paste are a common cause of `Malformed`. Paste the JWT as
a single unbroken line.
:::

## Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `PROXYTRACE_LICENSE` | The license token (a JWT). Trimmed before use. Takes precedence over the `Licensing:License` appsettings value, but a key activated in the UI (stored in the database) overrides both. Unset (and no config value) → Free tier. | _unset_ |
| `PROXYTRACE_LICENSE_SERVER_URL` | Override the license server base URL. **Debug builds only** — Release builds ignore this and always use the default. | `https://license.proxytrace.dev` |
| `PROXYTRACE_LICENSE_PUBLIC_KEY` | Override the signature-verification public keys (comma-separated, base64). **Debug builds only** — Release builds use the keys baked into the binary. | _embedded keys_ |
| `PROXYTRACE_LICENSE_CACHE_PATH` | Path to the offline license-status cache file. | `$PROXYTRACE_DATA_DIR/license-cache.json` when `PROXYTRACE_DATA_DIR` is set (the Docker deployment's `appdata` volume), else `<LocalApplicationData>/proxytrace/license-cache.json` |

::: warning Release builds ignore the Debug-only overrides
`PROXYTRACE_LICENSE_SERVER_URL` and `PROXYTRACE_LICENSE_PUBLIC_KEY` exist only to support
local development and testing. In a Release build they are ignored entirely; the license
server URL and public keys are fixed at compile time.
:::

### appsettings

These values live in `Proxytrace.Api/appsettings.json` under the `Licensing` section:

```json
{
  "Licensing": {
    "License": "eyJ...",
    "ServerCheckEnabled": true,
    "CheckIntervalHours": 24,
    "OfflineGracePeriodDays": 7
  }
}
```

- `License` — the license token (a JWT), as an alternative to the `PROXYTRACE_LICENSE`
  environment variable. The environment variable **wins** when both are set. Intended mainly
  for local debugging and testing — set it in `appsettings.local.json` (which is
  git-ignored) rather than committing a token. Unset in both → Free tier.
- `ServerCheckEnabled` — **Debug builds only.** Whether the background service contacts the
  license server for periodic revocation/grace checks. When `false`, the startup license
  snapshot is kept as-is and **no network calls** are made — useful so local dev does not need
  the license server reachable. Defaults to `false` in Debug. **Release builds ignore this
  setting entirely and always perform the server check.**
- `CheckIntervalHours` — how often the running app re-validates the license against the
  license server. Default **24**.
- `OfflineGracePeriodDays` — how long the app keeps operating on its last-known-good license
  status when the license server is unreachable, before downgrading to Free. Default **7**.

::: tip Keep this table in sync
The authoritative limits and feature sets live in
`Proxytrace.Licensing/LicensePolicy.cs`. If that file changes, update this table to match.
:::

::: info Kiosk mode is always Enterprise
Kiosk mode ignores `PROXYTRACE_LICENSE` entirely and runs on a built-in, perpetual
**Enterprise** license, so the public demo can showcase every feature.
:::

When you exceed a Free-tier limit (for example, trying to create a second project, invite
a fourth user, or create a second test suite), the request is rejected with HTTP **402** and
the UI raises an **upgrade dialog** explaining which limit was hit, with a link to the
Enterprise plans. When you access a premium feature without a license that includes it, the
API responds with HTTP **402** as well and the same dialog appears framed as a feature gate.

The current tier is always visible as a chip in the top bar — a muted, sparkle-marked **Free**
chip (which links to the upgrade page) on an unlicensed install, or a crowned tier chip on a
licensed one: gold when the license is active, amber while a re-check is pending. When the
monthly trace quota is exhausted, a banner appears above the top bar warning
that new traces are being dropped until the quota resets.

The **agent** limit is enforced differently because agents are discovered automatically from
captured traces rather than created by an explicit request. Once the agent limit is reached,
traces that would create a **new** agent are silently dropped (a warning is logged); traces
for agents that already exist continue to be captured normally. System agents (used
internally by optimizers and agentic evaluators) do not count toward the limit.

## Air-gapped and offline operation

Proxytrace contacts the license server (`https://license.proxytrace.dev`) **on startup** and
then **every 24 hours** (`CheckIntervalHours`) to confirm the license is still valid and has
not been revoked. Signature verification itself is fully offline — it never needs the
network — so the periodic check is only about revocation and updated entitlements.

If the license server cannot be reached, the app continues normally using its last
known-good status. This tolerance window is the **7-day offline grace period**
(`OfflineGracePeriodDays`):

| Time since last successful check | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Within 7 days | Full Enterprise operation. |
| Grace period active | Full operation continues, and a **grace banner** is shown in the UI warning that the license has not been re-validated. |
| After 7 days | The app **silently downgrades to Free**. Premium features stop working and limits revert to Free values. |

If the server explicitly reports the license as **revoked**, the app downgrades to Free
immediately rather than waiting out the grace period.

The last-known-good status is persisted to the cache file
(`PROXYTRACE_LICENSE_CACHE_PATH`) so that a restart during an outage does not reset the grace
window. The grace window above applies to a **normal** license that simply cannot reach the
server. For a permanently disconnected install, ask sales for an **offline-only license**
(below) instead of operating within the grace period.

### Offline-only licenses

For genuinely air-gapped installs, Proxytrace supports an **offline-only license**: a key that
is **never** checked against the license server, so it needs no outbound connectivity at all.
Ask sales for one (see [Where to buy](#where-to-buy)) — it activates exactly like a normal key
(setup wizard, **Settings → License**, or `PROXYTRACE_LICENSE`).

How it differs from a normal key:

- **No server contact, ever.** The periodic 24-hour check and the offline grace window do not
  apply — an offline key does not degrade just because there is no network. The **Settings →
  License** page shows an "offline license" note and hides **Re-check now** (there is nothing to
  ask the server).
- **Expiry is the only thing that ends it.** With no server check, the key works until its
  built-in expiry date, then downgrades to Free. Offline keys are capped at **365 days** and are
  typically issued for shorter — plan to obtain a fresh key before the current one expires.
- **It cannot be revoked.** Because the install never calls home, a leaked offline key keeps
  working until it expires, and key rotation does not retire it early. Treat it as a sensitive
  bearer credential, and prefer the shortest lifetime that fits your renewal cadence.

::: tip Online vs offline
A normal (online) key is the default and is preferable when the install has even occasional
connectivity — it can be revoked and re-issued, and it picks up entitlement changes. Choose an
offline-only key only for installs that will never reach `https://license.proxytrace.dev`.

## Key-rotation FAQ

Proxytrace verifies license signatures against a set of public keys embedded in the binary.
A license is accepted if **any** active key validates its signature. This lets us rotate
signing keys without invalidating licenses already in the field, using a staged
dual-key release playbook:

- **Release N — introduce the new key.** Ship a build that trusts **both** the current key
  and the next key. The new key is published but not yet used to sign anything. Existing
  licenses (signed by the old key) keep validating.
- **Release N+1 — sign with the new key.** New licenses are issued signed by the new key.
  Builds still trust both keys, so old and new licenses both validate during the transition.
- **Release N+2 — retire the old key.** Once enough time has passed for outstanding licenses
  to be re-issued, ship a build that trusts **only** the new key. The old key is dropped.

Because every release in the sequence trusts at least the key your license was signed with,
customers never experience a forced re-issue, and there is no flag day. If you operate in an
air-gapped environment, upgrade across these releases in order so you are never more than one
key generation behind.

**Q: I upgraded Proxytrace and now my license is rejected with `BadSignature`.**
Your license was likely signed with a key that the new build no longer trusts (you skipped
past Release N+2 of a rotation). Obtain a re-issued license — see
[Where to buy](#where-to-buy) — or, to keep running in the meantime, unset
`PROXYTRACE_LICENSE` to operate on the Free tier.
