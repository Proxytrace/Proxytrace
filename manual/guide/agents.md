# Agents

An **Agent** is a definition of an AI agent: its **system prompt**, its **tools**, the
**model endpoint** (model + provider) it runs on, and the **project** it belongs to.
Proxytrace detects agents automatically from captured traces and versions them as they
evolve.

## How agents are detected

As traces flow in, Proxytrace extracts the recurring shape of each agent — the system
prompt, the set of tool definitions, and the model endpoint — and records it as an Agent.
When you change a prompt or tool set in production, that change is captured as a new
version, giving you a history of how the agent evolved.

### Versioning rule

For every incoming call, Proxytrace decides whether the (system prompt, tool-set) pair
matches an existing agent or represents a brand-new one:

1. **Exact match** — the prompt and tool-set are byte-for-byte identical to an existing
   version. The call attaches to that version, no new row is created.
2. **Similar match** — the tool-set is identical when compared by tool name + parameter
   JSON schema (descriptions stripped), and the system prompt is at least 85 % similar
   (normalized Levenshtein ratio). The call creates a **new version** under the existing
   agent, and that version becomes the agent's current version.
3. **No match** — neither rule fires, so Proxytrace creates a brand-new agent with v1.

**Continuation calls.** A follow-up call within the same conversation (same `SessionId`) that
omits tools *and* sends the identical system prompt inherits the previous call's version
without re-evaluating the rules above. If the system prompt changes, the rules apply.

The similarity threshold is configurable via `AgentVersioningOptions.SimilarityThreshold`;
the candidate-cap before Levenshtein is `AgentVersioningOptions.MaxCandidates` (default 32).

### Naming an agent explicitly

A client can skip the matching rules entirely and tell Proxytrace which agent a call belongs
to by sending the **`X-Proxytrace-Agent`** header with the agent's name. When present:

- The call attaches to the named agent in your project, creating that agent the first time
  the name is seen.
- Its version (system prompt + tools) is captured straight from the request — no similarity
  comparison runs, so unrelated prompt or tool changes never split it into a separate agent.

This is how the built-in [Tracey](/guide/tracey) assistant always attributes cleanly to her
own agent. Use it for any client where you already know the agent's identity and want stable
grouping regardless of prompt drift.

### Fixing a misclassification

If Proxytrace created a new agent for what should have been a new version of an existing
one, you can re-parent the version from the agent's detail page:

1. Open the redundant agent.
2. Under **Versions**, click **Move…** on the offending version.
3. Pick the target agent. The version is renumbered to `max(target.versions) + 1`;
   every `AgentCall` referencing the version follows it automatically.
4. If the source agent has no versions left, it is deleted. The whole move runs in a
   single database transaction.

Moving versions into or out of a **system agent** is not allowed.

## The agent detail view

Pick an agent from the searchable list on the left to open its detail panel:

![The agent detail view: the agent list on the left, and the selected agent's header, performance tiles, system prompt, and version history on the right.](/screenshots/agents/detail.png)

- **Header card** — the agent avatar, name, current version, a *proposals ready* badge
  (when the agent has open [proposals](/guide/optimization-proposals)), and metadata
  (project, trace count, when it was last used). Controls on the right switch the model
  endpoint, **Run** the agent against its test suites, open an overflow (**⋯**) menu —
  open in the [Playground](/guide/capturing-traces), view traces, or view proposals — or
  delete the agent.
- **Performance** — a dedicated card, one little card per stat, in a single grid that reflows to fit
  the width. A `1h / 24h / 7d / 30d` selector sets the window (your choice sticks as you move between
  agents) and a **live** indicator marks that the figures update as traces arrive. The **totals** over
  the window come first, each with a mini sparkline: **pass rate** (and its change in percentage
  points), **traces**, **tokens** (with the input/output split), **cost**, and **avg latency** — then
  the per-call / per-conversation **distribution** cards for each metric (see [below](#distribution)).
- **Definition** (main column) — the **system prompt** (with its word/line count, a copy
  button, and — when a previous version exists — a **Diff vs v*N*** comparison against the
  prior revision), followed by the **tools** list (click a tool to expand its parameters,
  types, and enum values inline).
- **Version history** (right rail) — a timeline of every captured version, newest first,
  each showing its date and tool count with the current version highlighted. Click any
  version to view its system prompt and tools in the main column; use **Move…** to
  re-parent a version (see [Fixing a misclassification](#fixing-a-misclassification)).
  Below it, **suite pass rates** show how the agent scores per test suite — click a row to
  jump to that suite — followed by **recent traces** (the latest calls for the agent; click one
  to open it in the [Traces](/guide/capturing-traces) view), and the full model-parameter set
  sits in a collapsible panel that summarises temperature and max tokens when collapsed.

The performance stats and suite pass rates update live as new traces arrive.

### Distribution

Alongside the totals, the **Performance** card carries a **distribution** card for each metric, showing
how *consistent* the agent's calls are. Where the totals show averages, each distribution card shows the
**mean ± standard deviation** of one metric over the same time window, computed from the agent's
**successful** calls only — **input**
and **output tokens** and **latency** per call, and **cost**, **cache hit rate** and **tool calls** per
conversation. A large spread (big ± value) means the metric swings widely from call to call; a small
one means it is steady. Each card also draws a small **density curve** of the actual samples — a smooth
profile of the call shape (a tall, narrow peak = consistent; a long tail = a few slow or expensive
outliers). Hover the curve to read a slice's value range and the number of calls (or conversations) in
it. When every sample shares one value, the curve collapses to a single centred marker. Metrics with no
signal in the window — an agent that never caches or never calls a tool — drop out rather than show an
empty card.

![The Performance card on the agent detail page: one grid of stat cards — totals (pass rate, traces, tokens, cost, avg latency) each with a sparkline, flowing into distribution cards (input and output tokens and latency per call, cost per conversation), each a mean ± standard deviation with a small density curve of the samples.](/screenshots/agents/distribution.png)

| Metric | Measured per | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Input / output tokens** | call | Prompt and completion token counts. |
| **Latency** | call | Wall-clock time per call. |
| **Cost** | conversation | Summed across every call in the conversation. |
| **Cache hit (t≥2)** | conversation | Share of input tokens served from the provider cache, across the conversation's **second and later turns** — the first turn can never be a cache hit, so it is excluded. Single-turn conversations don't count. |
| **Tool calls** | conversation | How many tool calls the agent made across the conversation. |

Calls that aren't part of a tracked conversation are treated as their own single-turn
conversation. Each row's tooltip shows how many samples it is based on, and a metric with no
samples in the window shows **—**.

**Deleting an agent** removes it from the agent list and frees its licensed-agent slot, but keeps
its captured traces, versions, and test suites intact for historical reference. Built-in **system
agents** (Tracey, optimizers, and the judges behind agentic evaluators) can't be deleted. If the
same prompt-and-tools combination is observed in traffic again later, the agent reappears.

## What you can do with agents

- **Review the current definition** — system prompt, tool specifications, and model
  endpoint.
- **Compare versions** to see what changed between deployments.
- **Run evaluations against a specific agent version** — see
  [Running Tests](/guide/running-tests).
- **Act on proposals** that target an agent — see
  [Optimization Proposals](/guide/optimization-proposals).

## System agents

Some agents are **system agents** (flagged `IsSystemAgent`). These are built-in agents
Proxytrace uses internally — for example, to generate agent names or to power optimizers.
They use the project's configured **system endpoint** rather than your application traffic.
