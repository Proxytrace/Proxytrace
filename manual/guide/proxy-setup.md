# Proxy Setup

Proxytrace captures traffic by acting as an **OpenAI-compatible proxy**. Your agent keeps
talking to what looks like the OpenAI API; Proxytrace records the interaction and forwards
it to the real provider.

**Ingesting** simply means routing your agent's existing OpenAI calls through Proxytrace.
You change **two things** in your client and nothing else:

1. **Base URL** — point it at the Proxytrace proxy endpoint (below) instead of the provider's.
2. **API key** — either a **Proxytrace-issued API key** or your **existing upstream provider
   key**. Proxytrace accepts both and maps the call to the right project and provider.

No SDK swap, no code changes beyond configuration.

## What the proxy endpoint is

The proxy endpoint is the **`base_url` your OpenAI client points at**. It has three parts —
the proxy **host**, your **project slug**, and the fixed `/openai/v1` suffix:

<ProxyEndpoint />

::: tip Where to find your real endpoint
The host above is filled in **automatically when you read this page inside a running
Proxytrace instance** (it reflects the operator's [configured proxy URL](/admin/configuration)).
You can also copy the exact, ready-to-use endpoint straight from the app:

- the **first-run setup wizard**, which ends with copy-paste quick-start snippets (Python,
  TypeScript, C#, curl) for your project;
- the **Providers → API keys** table, which lists the per-project endpoint next to each key;
- the **“How to wire the proxy?”** link on the Traces page while it's still empty.
:::

::: warning The proxy is not the web UI — mind the port
The ingestion proxy runs as its **own service on its own port**. In the standard Docker
deployment the UI is on port `5101` and the proxy on port `5102`; sending OpenAI calls to the
UI port returns `405 Not Allowed`. Always use the host the app advertises, not the address in
your browser's URL bar.

## What you change

### Which key to use

- **Proxytrace-issued key (recommended)** — carries its own project, so attribution is
  automatic and the key can be revoked per client. The project segment in the URL is optional;
  if you include it, it must match the key's project.
- **Upstream provider key** — lets you migrate an existing app onto Proxytrace by changing
  only the base URL. The key identifies the upstream provider; the **project comes from the URL
  path** (see below), so you must include the project segment. If the same upstream key is used
  by several projects, the path is what disambiguates them.
- **Collisions.** If the same string is valid as both a Proxytrace key and an upstream
  provider key, the Proxytrace key wins.

### The project segment

The proxy base URL carries the project as the first path segment:

```
https://your-proxytrace-host/{project}/openai/v1
```

`{project}` is the **slug** of the project name — lower-cased, with non-alphanumeric characters
dropped and spaces turned into hyphens. For example, project **"Showcase Project"** →
`showcase-project`. The slug is derived automatically; there is nothing to configure.

The legacy `https://your-proxytrace-host/openai/v1` form (no project segment) still works for
Proxytrace-issued keys, since the key already carries its project.

## Create an API key

A Proxytrace **API Key** is tied to a **Project** and a **Model Provider**. Create one from
the Providers area of the UI (operators can also manage these — see
[Providers & API Keys](/admin/providers-and-api-keys)).

1. Open **Providers**.
2. Choose the upstream provider the key should route to (e.g. OpenAI).
3. Generate a key and copy it — treat it like a secret.

## Point your client at the proxy

Example using the OpenAI Python SDK:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    # Project slug + /openai/v1. Works with a Proxytrace key or your upstream provider key.
    base_url="https://your-proxytrace-host/showcase-project/openai/v1",
    api_key="pt-...",  # Proxytrace-issued key, or your upstream provider key
    # Optional but recommended: name your agent for deterministic attribution.
    default_headers={"x-proxytrace-agent": "my-agent"},
)

resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
)
```

The call runs exactly as before — but it is now captured. Open **Traces** to confirm it
arrives. See [Capturing Traces](/guide/capturing-traces).

### Name your agent with a header (recommended)

By default Proxytrace [detects agents](/guide/agents#how-agents-are-detected) by comparing
each call's system prompt and tool-set against known agents. For **deterministic** attribution,
send the **`x-proxytrace-agent`** header with your agent's name on every call (e.g. via your
SDK's default-headers option, as in the snippet above). The call then attaches directly to the
named agent — created on first sight — and the similarity matcher is skipped entirely, so
prompt or tool changes never split your traffic into a separate agent. See
[Naming an agent explicitly](/guide/agents#naming-an-agent-explicitly).

::: warning Requests can be blocked in real time
If the project has [blocking anomaly detectors](/guide/anomaly-dashboard#blocking-detectors)
configured (an Enterprise feature — e.g. a password-pattern guard), the proxy rejects a matching
request **before it reaches the provider** with HTTP `403` and an OpenAI-style error whose `code`
is `proxytrace_blocked`. The blocked call still appears as a flagged trace.
:::

## Listing models

`client.models.list()` (`GET /openai/v1/models`) is forwarded to your upstream provider, so
your client sees the provider's model list.

::: tip Azure OpenAI
Azure has no OpenAI-style `/models` route — its usable models are exposed as **deployments**.
Proxytrace detects an Azure upstream and lists its deployments instead, so `models.list()`
returns your deployment names (e.g. `gpt-4o-prod`) rather than an empty list.
:::

## Reaching other upstream endpoints

Some upstreams expose endpoints beyond the chat/completions API — most commonly a **health
check** (`/health`), but also anything else the provider serves at its host. Because your
client's base URL points at Proxytrace, a call to `https://your-proxytrace-host/{project}/health`
would otherwise have nowhere to go.

Proxytrace **transparently forwards any path under `/{project}/…` that is not part of the
`openai/v1` API** straight to the upstream provider's host, using the provider's real key. So
`GET /{project}/health` reaches the upstream's `/health`, `GET /{project}/v1/models` reaches its
`/v1/models`, and so on — no configuration needed.

These pass-through calls are **not captured as traces** (only the `openai/v1` API is). They still
require a valid key for the project, exactly like a traced call. If the upstream answers with a
redirect, Proxytrace relays the `3xx` (including its `Location`) back to your client verbatim
rather than following it server-side — `Location` values are not rewritten to proxy URLs.

::: tip Which upstream, which path
The target is the **host** of the project's provider — the same provider your LLM calls resolve
to. The path after `/{project}/` is forwarded to that host's root, so `/{project}/health` maps to
`https://<upstream-host>/health`, alongside (not under) the provider's `/v1` API path.
