/// One-time, idempotent backfill of <see cref="AgentCallEntity.RequestPreview"/> for traces ingested
/// before that column existed. The column was added nullable, without a data migration, and the
/// traces list reads this denormalised preview directly — so rows written earlier render no message
/// preview until they are backfilled.
///
/// Runs after the database initializer (migrations applied) and before the app serves traffic. It
/// processes rows in bounded batches <c>WHERE RequestPreview IS NULL</c>, computing the preview from
/// the stored request via <see cref="AgentCallPreview.Build"/> so the result matches ingestion exactly.
/// A request with no user message gets an empty-string marker rather than null, so every processed row
/// leaves the candidate set: the set strictly shrinks, the pass terminates, and a re-run is a no-op.
/// The batch bound means a database with millions of pre-existing traces is never materialised at once.
/// It never fails host boot — the only impact of a failure is that older traces keep showing no preview
/// until a later restart re-runs it.
