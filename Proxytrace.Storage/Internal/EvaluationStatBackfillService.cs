/// One-time, idempotent backfill of the <see cref="EvaluationStatEntity"/> projection for test results
/// recorded before that table existed (added by the <c>AddEvaluationStatProjection</c> migration without
/// a data migration). The evaluator-statistics queries read this projection directly, so a result with no
/// projection row contributes nothing to its evaluators' average score / evaluation count / pass rate —
/// the page shows an em-dash or zero even though the authoritative evaluation still lives in the JSON
/// <see cref="TestResultEntity.Evaluations"/> column.
///
/// Runs after the database initializer (migrations applied) and before the app serves traffic. It walks
/// the results that have no projection row yet in bounded, keyset-paginated batches and rebuilds each
/// result's projection rows from its stored evaluations — exactly as <c>TestResultConfig.Map</c> does on
/// insert — so the backfilled rows match newly-written ones. A result that carries no evaluations can
/// never gain a projection row, so it would never leave the candidate set; the advancing
/// <c>(CreatedAt, Id)</c> cursor steps past it instead of looping on it forever. The batch bound means a
/// database with millions of pre-existing results is never materialised at once. It never fails host boot
/// — the only impact of a failure is that older results keep showing no statistics until a later restart
