/// <summary>
/// Wire format for a captured proxy call handed from the ingestion proxy service to the
/// main app's ingestion worker. Holds only primitive identifiers and the raw bodies — the
/// consumer re-hydrates the <c>IModelProvider</c>/<c>IProject</c> from the shared database by id.
/// <para>
/// <c>AgentName</c>, when set, identifies the owning agent explicitly (e.g. via the
/// <c>X-Proxytrace-Agent</c> request header or a same-origin client like Tracey). The consumer then
/// attributes the call to that named agent directly, skipping the prompt/tool similarity matcher.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The <c>Blocked*</c> fields are set when the proxy rejected the call before it reached the
/// upstream provider (a blocking anomaly detector's trigger matched the request body).
/// <c>ResponseBody</c> then carries the synthetic error JSON the client received — the request was
/// never forwarded. All three are trailing optionals so older messages already in the stream keep
/// deserializing during a rolling deploy.
/// </para>
