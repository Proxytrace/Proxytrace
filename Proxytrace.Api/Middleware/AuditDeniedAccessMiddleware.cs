/// <summary>
/// Records an <see cref="AuditAction.AccessDenied"/> failure when a state-changing request
/// (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) is rejected with <c>403 Forbidden</c> — an authenticated caller attempting
/// something beyond their permission (non-admin hitting an admin route, a member acting on another
/// project, a license-gated feature). The denial is attributed to the caller (their id was stashed at
/// authentication time), so probing and privilege-escalation attempts are visible in the audit log.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Deliberate scope: only <c>403</c> is captured, not <c>401</c> — an unauthenticated request carries
/// no actor and overlaps the dedicated <see cref="AuditAction.LoginFailed"/> signal, so it would be
/// noise. Access checks that hide existence behind a <c>404</c> (the project access guard) are
/// indistinguishable from genuine 404s here and are intentionally not recorded. This middleware must
/// sit <em>before</em> <c>UseAuthorization</c> in the pipeline so it still runs when authorization
/// short-circuits the request with a 403.
/// </remarks>
