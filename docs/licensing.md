# Licensing

`Proxytrace.Licensing` gates product capabilities behind license tiers. `ILicenseService` is the
**single source of truth** for licensing decisions across the application — never hard-code tier
checks or duplicate gating logic elsewhere.

```csharp
public interface ILicenseService
{
    LicenseSnapshot Current { get; }            // never null; defaults to Free
    event Action Changed;                       // fires when the tier changes (e.g. background downgrade)
    bool IsFeatureEnabled(LicenseFeature feature);
    long GetLimit(LicenseLimit limit);          // long.MaxValue == unlimited
    Task ForceRefreshAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}
```

## Directives

- **Gate every premium capability through `ILicenseService`.** Before exposing or executing a gated
  feature, check `IsFeatureEnabled(...)` / `GetLimit(...)`. Current gated features:
  `OptimizationProposals`, `AgenticEvaluators`, `CustomEvaluators`, `SsoOidc`, `AuditLog`, `Tracey`,
  `ScheduledTestRuns`, `CustomAnomalyDetectors`.
- **`Current` is never null** and defaults to the **Free** tier — write code that degrades to Free,
  never code that assumes a paid tier or null-guards the snapshot.
- **Treat `long.MaxValue` from `GetLimit` as unlimited** — do not cap or special-case it elsewhere.
- **React to `Changed`** for long-lived state: the tier can change at runtime — downgraded by a
  background license-server check, or **replaced entirely** when an admin sets/removes a license
  key in the UI — so cached feature decisions must be invalidated.
- License tokens are **JWT, verified against bundled public keys** (`LicensePublicKeys`). Never trust
  an unverified tier value; always go through the service.
- The trusted keys are fixed at **compile time**: `LicensePublicKeys.GetActiveKeys()` returns the
  embedded production key unless the build ran with `-p:LicensePublicKey=<base64-spki>[,<more>]`
  (Docker build-arg `LICENSE_PUBLIC_KEY`), which bakes replacement keys into assembly metadata.
  The dev/e2e composes use it to trust the committed test-signed license JWTs; official release
  images pass no override. The `PROXYTRACE_LICENSE_PUBLIC_KEY` **runtime** env override exists only
  in Debug builds — never extend it to Release, or official-image operators could self-sign.
- The repo is public under the **Elastic License 2.0**, whose "may not remove or circumvent the
  license key functionality" limitation is the legal backstop for these gates: building a
  gate-stripped fork is a license violation even though the source is readable.
- When adding a new gated capability, add a `LicenseFeature`/`LicenseLimit` member and assign it to
  the right `TierDefinition` rather than checking the tier enum directly at the call site.

## Runtime license management (set/remove without restart)

The effective license resolves in this precedence order: **database-stored key → environment JWT
(`PROXYTRACE_LICENSE` / `Licensing:License`) → Free**. Kiosk's `OverrideSnapshot` short-circuits
everything and is not user-manageable.

- `LicenseSnapshot` carries a `Source` (`None`/`Environment`/`Stored`/`Override`) and, when a
  configured key fails validation, `Status = Invalid` + `InvalidReason` with **Free entitlements**.
  An invalid license **never crashes the host** (the old fail-fast startup gate is gone); the UI
  surfaces a banner instead.
- `ILicenseActivator` (`Proxytrace.Licensing`) — validation + snapshot swap:
  `Validate` (dry run, throws `InvalidLicenseException`), `Activate` (throws; current license kept
  on rejection), `ActivateOrInvalid` (never throws — applies an Invalid snapshot), and
  `ActivateConfigured` (re-resolves override/env/Free; used on remove).
- `ILicenseKeyManager` (`Proxytrace.Application.Licensing`) — orchestrates persistence:
  `SetAsync` validates → persists via `IStoredLicenseStore` (single-row `StoredLicenseEntity` in
  Storage) → activates as `Stored`; `RemoveAsync` deletes and falls back via `ActivateConfigured`.
- `StoredLicenseStartupService` (Application hosted service, registered **after** the database
  initializer) applies the stored key once migrations have run. Failures are logged, never fatal.
- `LicenseCheckService` reacts to `Changed` — a license activated at runtime starts revocation
  checks; it no longer latches onto the startup snapshot.
- API: `GET /api/license` (anonymous; includes `source`/`invalidReason`),
  `POST /api/license/validate` (anonymous dry run), `PUT /api/license` (admin, **or anonymous while
  no users exist** — the setup wizard's gate), `DELETE /api/license` (admin),
  `POST /api/license/refresh` (admin). Manage endpoints 409 under a kiosk override.
- The license offline-grace cache and the auto-generated signing key live in
  `PROXYTRACE_DATA_DIR` when set (the Docker deployment mounts the `appdata` volume there).

## Offline-only licenses

An **offline-only** license is for air-gapped installs that cannot reach the license server. The
JWT carries one extra claim, `offline` (a JSON boolean), and the server emits it **present and
`true`** only on these keys — a normal online license omits the claim entirely.

- `JwtLicenseValidator` parses `offline` by JSON type onto `LicenseSnapshot.Offline` (true only when
  present and exactly `true`; absent / `false` / any other value ⇒ online). Everything else about the
  token — ES256 signature, `iss`/`aud`/`exp` validation against the bundled public keys — is
  unchanged, so an offline token still verifies fully offline.
- `LicenseCheckService` **skips the periodic `/licenses/check` call entirely** for an offline
  snapshot (both the background loop and the admin "Re-check now" / `ForceRefreshAsync` path). The
  offline-grace state machine (the `OfflineGracePeriodDays` window that degrades a *normal* license
  when the server is unreachable) therefore never runs for these keys — they do not degrade just
  because there is no network.
- With no server check, **`exp` is the only thing that ends an offline license**, and it is enforced
  locally: an already-expired token is rejected at validation (`ValidateLifetime`), and a token that
  expires *while running* is downgraded to `Expired`/Free by `EnforceOfflineExpiry`. The loop wakes
  at the sooner of the check interval and the moment `exp` lands so the license ends on time.
- **Security:** an offline key cannot be revoked (the client never contacts the server, so
  `revoke`/`reissue` and key rotation have no effect on it) and is a bearer credential that works on
  unlimited installs until `exp`. The server caps offline `exp` at ≤365 days; that time bound is the
  only containment lever. Prefer the shortest viable lifetime.
- `Offline` flows through to the API (`GET /api/license` → `LicenseDto.offline`,
  `POST /api/license/validate` → `ValidateLicenseResultDto.offline`); the settings License page
  surfaces it (an "offline license" note and no "Re-check now" button, since there is nothing to
  ask the server).

## Notes on specific gates

- **`AgenticEvaluators`** is enforced at *use* time, not creation time. Default agentic evaluators
  are provisioned for every project regardless of tier (`IDefaultEvaluatorProvisioner`); the gate
  applies in two places: (1) `TestRunnerService` skips agentic evaluators during a run when the
  feature is disabled — they are silently not run, never errored, so the pass rate is computed over
  judged evaluators; (2) the suite editor (`EvaluatorsPanel`) locks unattached agentic evaluators on
  the frontend. An agentic evaluator attached while licensed simply stops running after a downgrade.
- **`ScheduledTestRuns`** (Enterprise) is enforced both at *creation* and at *use*. The
  `TestRunSchedulesController` decorates create/update/delete/run-now with
  `[RequiresFeature(LicenseFeature.ScheduledTestRuns)]` (returns **402** when unlicensed); listing
  stays ungated so existing schedules remain visible. At use time `TestRunSchedulerService` skips
  unlicensed schedules without deleting them, so a downgrade pauses scheduled runs and a re-upgrade
  resumes them — the feature degrades gracefully rather than destroying configuration.
- **`CustomAnomalyDetectors`** (Enterprise) gates the user-defined LLM-based anomaly detectors. The
  whole `CustomAnomalyDetectorsController` (all CRUD, including list) carries
  `[RequiresFeature(LicenseFeature.CustomAnomalyDetectors)]` and returns **402** when unlicensed, so
  the management UI is hidden without a license. The anomaly *dashboard* itself (timeline,
  recent-flagged list) is ungated — it also surfaces the built-in statistical outliers, which every
  tier gets. The same feature also covers **real-time blocking** (`BlockUpstream` detectors enforced
  in the proxy): the proxy references `Proxytrace.Licensing` and its `CachedBlockingRuleProvider`
  checks `IsFeatureEnabled(CustomAnomalyDetectors)` at use time — unlicensed, no requests are
  blocked but the configuration is preserved (graceful degrade, mirroring `ScheduledTestRuns`). The
  proxy runs the licensing module with `ServerCheckEnabled = false` (the main app owns the
  license-server heartbeat and the offline-grace cache) and applies the DB-stored license via a
  polling `ProxyStoredLicenseService` (~5 min, configurable `Licensing:StoredLicensePollSeconds`);
  accepted consequence: a revoked-but-unexpired license keeps blocking active in the proxy until it
  expires or the stored key is removed.
