# Secrets at Rest

How Proxytrace protects persisted secrets. Read this before adding a new secret-bearing field, or
before touching encryption, hashing, the Data Protection key ring, or the secrets backfill.

## The rule: encrypt vs hash

A secret's treatment is decided by **how it is used**, not by what it is:

- **Replayable secret** — Proxytrace must recover the plaintext and send it to a third party (or
  recompute against it). These are reversibly **encrypted** (`ISecretProtector`). Example:
  `ModelProvider.ApiKey` (the upstream provider credential, replayed on every proxied/outbound call),
  the SMTP password, and `UserTotpEnrollment.Secret` (the TOTP/MFA shared secret — the server must
  reproduce it to verify each authenticator code, so it is encrypted in the storage mapper exactly
  like `ApiKey`; see [`docs/mfa.md`](mfa.md)).
- **Verify-only credential** — only ever compared against a presented value, never replayed. These
  are one-way **hashed** (`ISecretHasher`); the plaintext is shown once at creation and is
  unrecoverable afterwards. Example: `ApiKey.KeyHash` (inbound Proxytrace keys), `Invite.TokenHash`,
  `PasswordResetToken.TokenHash` (the forgot-password / admin reset link — 32-byte CSPRNG, 1-hour TTL,
  single-use; the raw token is emailed, logged for the operator, or returned as an admin link exactly
  once), and `MfaBackupCode.CodeHash` (the one-time MFA recovery codes — shown once at enrollment,
  each consumed independently).

Never hash a replayable secret (you could not replay it) and never reversibly encrypt a verify-only
credential (a database dump would then yield usable credentials).

## The reusable seams

The product-agnostic **interfaces** (`ISecretProtector`, `ISecretHasher`) live in
`Nordstein.Core.Common.Security`, so other Nordstein products can implement the same ports and the
storage layer can consume them without referencing `Application` (issue #270). Their Proxytrace
**implementations** (`DataProtectionSecretProtector`, `Sha256SecretHasher`) and the DI module
(`SecretProtectionModule`) stay in `Proxytrace.Infrastructure.Security` — they own the product-specific
Data Protection purpose, application name, key-ring location, and operational diagnostics. This is the
lowest product layer both the API host and the lean ingestion proxy can reach without loading `Application`.

- **`ISecretProtector`** — `Protect`/`Unprotect`, backed by ASP.NET Core Data Protection
  (`DataProtectionSecretProtector`, purpose `"Proxytrace.Secrets.v1"`). The seam and its key ring are
  registered together in `Proxytrace.Infrastructure/Security/SecretProtectionModule.cs` (application name
  `"Proxytrace"`, persisted to `PROXYTRACE_DATA_DIR/dataprotection-keys`); without it the ring is
  ephemeral and ciphertext does not survive a restart. **Both hosts that touch encrypted secrets — the
  API (writer) and the lean ingestion proxy (reader, which decrypts the upstream provider key before
  replaying it) — load this module and must mount the *same* `PROXYTRACE_DATA_DIR` volume**, or the
  proxy cannot decrypt what the API wrote (the deploy/e2e compose files wire the shared `appdata`
  volume into both). Reads degrade gracefully on a `CryptographicException` (treat the secret as unset
  + log) rather than crashing a hot path — see `ModelProviderConfig.Decrypt` and
  `EmailSettingsStore.DecryptPassword`.
- **`ISecretHasher`** — `Hash(value)` → hex SHA-256 (`Sha256SecretHasher`, delegating to the shared
  `Nordstein.Core.Common.Security.Sha256.HexHash`). Deterministic and **key-ring-independent**, so the
  verify paths keep working even if `PROXYTRACE_DATA_DIR` is lost. Unkeyed SHA-256 is safe **only**
  because every secret it covers is a 256-bit CSPRNG value Proxytrace generated itself (inbound API
  keys, invite tokens, password-reset tokens) — a dump cannot reverse or forge them. **Not for
  passwords** (use `IPasswordService`, which is salted + slow), and **not for anything a human
  chooses** (see `ISecretIndexer`).
- **`ISecretIndexer`** — `Index(value)` → `"hmac1:"` + hex HMAC-SHA256 (`HmacSecretIndexer`), for a
  blind index over a secret that is **not** guaranteed to be high-entropy. Today that is exactly one
  value: the **operator-entered upstream provider API key**. The CSPRNG argument above does not
  apply to it — an operator types it in, and `OpenAiCompatible` self-hosted backends conventionally
  use `EMPTY`, `ollama`, or `sk-1234`. Under an unkeyed hash a database dump yields those by
  wordlist in seconds, undoing the column encryption sitting right beside them. The HMAC key is not
  in the database, so the dump alone is no longer enough.

The contracts and `Sha256` primitive live in `Nordstein.Core.Common`; Proxytrace chooses where each
contract is appropriate and supplies the implementations.

### A missing `PROXYTRACE_DATA_DIR` must be loud

An unset variable is not an error — Development and every test harness legitimately run on an
in-memory ring — but in a real deployment it silently destroys every encrypted secret on each
restart, and the three decrypt paths (`ModelProviderConfig`, `UserTotpEnrollmentConfig`,
`EmailSettingsStore`) degrade the resulting `CryptographicException` at **Warning** only. The
operator Error Log captures `>= Error`, so the outage would present purely as upstream 401s and
"invalid authenticator code" with nothing to look at. Two things close that hole:

- `KeyRingPersistenceCheck` (an `IHostedService` in `SecretProtectionModule.cs`) logs at
  **Critical** at startup when the variable is unset, and at Information with the resolved path
  when it is. It never throws.
- Both split-shape Dockerfiles (`Proxytrace.Api/Dockerfile`, `Proxytrace.Proxy.Api/Dockerfile`)
  set `ENV PROXYTRACE_DATA_DIR=/app/data` — the path the composes already mount the shared
  `appdata` volume at — so a hand-written manifest inherits the safe default. The single-container
  image keeps its own `/data/appdata`. An explicit environment value still overrides.

## Blind-index lookup

Encryption is non-deterministic (random IV), so an encrypted column cannot be looked up or indexed by
value. Where a replayable secret also needs a by-value lookup, store a deterministic **blind-index
hash** column alongside the ciphertext and query that:

- `ModelProvider.ApiKey` (ciphertext) + `ModelProviderEntity.ApiKeyLookupHash` (indexed) —
  `FindByApiKeyAsync` indexes the presented key and matches the index, then decrypts the row.

### The provider-key index is keyed (HMAC), and why it has two schemes

This index uses `ISecretIndexer`, not `ISecretHasher`, for the entropy reason above. Two consequences
follow, and both are load-bearing:

- **The HMAC key lives in `PROXYTRACE_DATA_DIR/dataprotection-keys/blind-index.key`**, created once
  with owner-only permissions (`BlindIndexKey`). It is a separate file rather than something derived
  from the Data Protection ring because Data Protection deliberately exposes no stable raw key
  material. **Every host that resolves provider credentials must mount the same volume** — the same
  requirement the key ring already has. Deleting the file is how you rotate: restart, and the
  startup backfill re-indexes from the decrypted keys.
- **When no data directory is configured the index falls back to the legacy unkeyed form**, and says
  so at Warning. It deliberately does *not* invent a per-process key: that would produce indexes
  that stop matching after the next restart, silently breaking upstream authentication for every
  provider. Development and the test harnesses therefore behave exactly as before.

Stored values are **scheme-prefixed** (`hmac1:`) because a hex SHA-256 and a hex HMAC-SHA256 are both
64 characters, so length cannot tell them apart. `FindByApiKeyAsync` matches **both** forms in one
indexed query — rows predating the change keep authenticating until
`SecretsBackfillService.ReindexProviderKeysAsync` upgrades them on the next start — and the prefix
means the two can never collide onto the wrong provider. An undecryptable row is left untouched by
that pass rather than re-indexed to the HMAC of an empty string.

Hashed secrets need no separate column: the stored value *is* the hash, so the repository hashes the
presented raw value before the equality lookup (`ApiKeyRepository.FindByKeyAsync`,
`InviteRepository.FindByTokenAsync`).

## Where each transform lives

- **Encrypt** happens at the **storage mapper boundary** (`ModelProviderConfig.Map`): encrypt + set
  the lookup hash on write, decrypt on read. This round-trips safely through edits (load decrypts →
  save re-encrypts). The protector is injected as `Lazy<ISecretProtector>` so design-time migration
  tooling can build the model without a key ring.
- **Hash** happens at the **creation site** (the value entering the domain is already the hash:
  `ModelProvidersController.CreateKey`, `InviteService.CreateAsync`) and at **lookup time** in the
  repository. It must **not** happen in the mapper — a hashed entity that is re-saved (e.g.
  `Invite.MarkConsumedAsync`) would otherwise be double-hashed.

## Secrets must not survive `ToString()`

A `record`'s generated `ToString()`/`PrintMembers` prints **every** member, so a secret-bearing
record leaks its plaintext the first time anyone writes `logger.LogX("… {Settings}", settings)`,
interpolates it into an exception message, or looks at it in a debugger. **Every record that carries
a replayable secret must override `PrintMembers` and render that member as `***`** — the rest of the
members stay, so the type is still useful in a log line. The member itself stays public and part of
record equality; only its textual rendering is masked.

Current overrides: `ModelProvider` (`ApiKey`, the reference implementation), `EmailSettings`
(`Password`), `UserTotpEnrollment` (`Secret`), `KioskEndpointOptions` and `ResolvedKioskEndpoint`
(`ApiKey`), `User` (`PasswordHash`). Note the accessibility differs: a sealed record deriving from
`object` must declare `private bool PrintMembers(StringBuilder)`, one deriving from another record
`protected override bool PrintMembers(StringBuilder)` (and must chain to `base.PrintMembers`).
`Proxytrace.Domain.Tests/SecretRedactionToStringTests` pins all six.

Only **credentials** are masked — identifiers stay readable, so a redacted record is still useful for
telling *who* or *what* a log line is about. Hence `User.Email` and `User.ExternalSubject` (the OIDC
subject: a stable identifier, not something you can authenticate with) render in full, the way
`EmailSettings.Username` does. `User` matters more than its own logging sites suggest: it is printed
transitively by every record holding an `IUser` (`UserTotpEnrollment.User`, `ApiKey.Owner`). Its
`PasswordHash` is a salted, slow `IPasswordService` hash rather than a plaintext, so masking it is
defence in depth — but a hash in the operator Error Log or a support bundle is an offline-cracking
target.

## Backfill of pre-existing rows

The product shipped with plaintext secrets, so `SecretsBackfillService` (an `IHostedService`
registered after the database initializer) protects existing rows in place on first boot. It is
idempotent and per-row (a partial run resumes; a re-run is a no-op), keyed on a marker per table:

| Table | "Not yet protected" marker | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `ModelProvider` | `ApiKeyLookupHash IS NULL` | encrypt `ApiKey`, set the lookup hash |
| `ApiKey` | `KeyHash` length ≠ 64 | hash the plaintext in `KeyHash`, set `KeyPrefix` |
| `Invite` | `TokenHash` length ≠ 64 | hash the plaintext token |

The two hash markers read the **protected column itself** (a hex SHA-256 is always 64 chars; the
pre-retrofit plaintexts never are). Do not move a marker into a companion column: it is then only as
durable as that column's mapper. `ApiKey` used `KeyPrefix IS NULL` until it turned out `ApiKeyConfig`
collapses that null (`stored.KeyPrefix ?? string.Empty`) and writes `""` back on every round trip, so
one save of an un-backfilled row would have hidden it from the pass forever — leaving the plaintext in
`KeyHash`, where `FindByKeyAsync` (which hashes the presented value) can never match it.

The accompanying migration (`ProtectSecretsAtRest`) **renames** the verify-only columns
(`ApiKey`→`KeyHash`, `Token`→`TokenHash`) rather than dropping and re-adding them, so the existing
plaintext survives into the new column for the backfill to read. A drop+add would destroy live keys
and pending invites. When changing these columns, hand-check the generated migration emits
`RenameColumn`, not drop+add.

**Failure handling.** Each table's pass is retried a few times for transient faults; a persistent
failure is logged at **Critical** (surfaced in the operator Error Log) instead of crashing boot. The
impact is real: until a row is backfilled its lookup column still holds the pre-retrofit plaintext,
so the hashed/encrypted lookup cannot match it — the affected existing API keys, provider auth, and
pending invites **do not authenticate until a restart re-runs the backfill to completion**.
Credentials created after the upgrade are unaffected.

## Credential freshness at the ingestion proxy (no positive credential cache)

The proxy resolves inbound credentials (`Proxytrace.Proxy/Internal/ApiKeyResolver.cs`, shared lib) **from
storage on every request** — deliberately uncached. A cached `ResolvedApiKey` carries the decrypted
upstream provider key, so any TTL becomes a window in which a rotated key keeps being forwarded and
a revoked inbound credential keeps authenticating, independently per proxy replica (#407; a
cross-process invalidation broadcast was rejected because a disconnected/restarting replica can miss
it). Rotation and revocation therefore take effect on the **next request**; when the database is
unreachable the proxy **fails closed** (the request errors) rather than serving stale credentials.
The per-request cost is a few indexed point lookups plus one Data Protection decrypt, guarded by the
`proxyResolve*` budgets in `perf/perf-budgets.json`. Do not reintroduce positive caching on this
path; the freshness guarantee is pinned by `ApiKeyResolverRotationTests`.

## Proxy scopes: capture and pass-through are separate capabilities

`ApiKeyScopes.Ingestion` admits a key to the ingestion proxy. It does **not** admit it to the
untraced pass-through (`OpenAiProxyController.Passthrough`), which needs `ApiKeyScopes.Passthrough`.

The split exists because the two differ in kind, not degree. Pass-through relays **any method and any
path** to the provider's host origin with the organisation's real upstream credential attached, and
is deliberately not evaluated by detectors, not traced, and not audited — Proxytrace does not
interpret those payloads. On a provider serving account or organization-management routes at the same
host, that is the provider account's reach, which should not follow from "may record LLM calls".

Two properties to preserve:

- **Existing keys were grandfathered** by `GrantPassthroughScopeToExistingApiKeys` (a data-only
  migration ORing the bit into every key that already held `Ingestion`), so upgrading does not break
  the documented `/health` setup. New keys must request the scope.
- **The upstream-provider-key auth path is intentionally ungated.** `ResolvedApiKey.Scopes` is
  `null` there, and the check skips: a caller holding the provider's own credential can call the
  provider directly, so restricting which of its paths they reach *through Proxytrace* protects
  nothing.

## Threat model

Protects **database dumps and backups**: the encryption key ring lives outside the database (in
`PROXYTRACE_DATA_DIR`), and the hashes are one-way over high-entropy secrets. It does **not** defend
against an attacker who holds **both** the database and the data directory — acceptable for a
self-hosted, single-deployment product.

## Password-reset link logging (emergency recovery)

`PasswordResetService` (`Proxytrace.Application/Auth/Local/Internal/`) issues a single-use, 1-hour,
hash-stored reset token. The link is normally emailed; when SMTP is unconfigured **or** the send
fails, the service falls back to the operator log so a locked-out user — including a **sole admin** —
can still recover. That fallback is gated:

- **`Authentication:EmergencyLogResetLink` (default `false`)** — the warning is **redacted**: it
  carries only a truncated, one-way **token hint** (the first 12 hex chars of the stored `TokenHash`,
  enough to correlate the log line with the DB row, useless for reconstructing the live token), the
  expiry, and a one-line instruction telling the operator how to enable emergency logging. The live
  token/URL is **never** written, so a reader of the operator log cannot take over the account within
  the TTL.
- **`Authentication:EmergencyLogResetLink = true`** — break-glass: the full one-time reset URL is
  logged at Warning. Use this only while actively recovering a locked-out sole admin with no working
  SMTP, then turn it back off — anyone with log read access within the 1-hour TTL can take over the
  account.

Operators always have two non-logged recovery paths that do **not** require this flag: configure SMTP
([`/admin/email`](../manual/admin/email.md)), or, if another admin exists, mint a link directly from
**Settings → Users → Reset password** (shown once in the UI, never logged). The flag exists only for
the genuine sole-admin-plus-no-email lockout.

## Reverse-proxy trust: forwarded headers

The documented topology terminates TLS at a reverse proxy (`frontend/nginx.conf`) and forwards to the
API **over plain HTTP**. Without processing `X-Forwarded-*` the API therefore sees `http` as the
scheme and the proxy container's address as the client for *every* request. `Program.cs` runs
`UseForwardedHeaders` as its **first** middleware, processing `XForwardedFor | XForwardedProto`, so
rate-limit partition keys, audit trails and generated absolute URLs describe the real client.

Those headers are attacker-controlled unless the peer that sent them is trusted, and an unrestricted
`X-Forwarded-For` is *worse* than none: it turns the rate-limit partition key into a value the client
picks, defeating throttling entirely. The trust set is therefore operator-declared under the
**`ForwardedHeaders`** config section (`TrustedProxyConfiguration` in `Program.cs`):

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ForwardedHeaders:Enabled` | `true` | Set `false` to skip the middleware entirely. |
| `ForwardedHeaders:KnownProxies` | *(none)* | Trusted proxy addresses. Comma-separated or an array. |
| `ForwardedHeaders:KnownNetworks` | *(none)* | Trusted CIDR ranges, e.g. `172.16.0.0/12`. |
| `ForwardedHeaders:ForwardLimit` | `1` | Number of trusted proxy hops. |

Both this section and `RateLimiting` below are read from the **host** configuration
(`appsettings.json` + environment variables), not from `appsettings.local.json` — they are deployment
settings, and the middleware/limiters are wired before the Autofac container (which owns the
`appsettings.local.json` view) exists.

**With nothing declared the trust set is the framework default — loopback only.** That is the
fail-safe choice: it never trusts a forged header, but it also means that behind a *containerised*
proxy (whose address is not loopback) the forwarded headers are ignored and the per-IP limiters below
collapse into one global bucket. **An operator running the split deployment must declare the proxy**,
e.g. on the `api` service in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
- ForwardedHeaders__KnownNetworks=172.16.0.0/12   # the compose bridge network
```

Narrow this to the proxy's own address (`ForwardedHeaders__KnownProxies=<nginx ip>`) where the
address is stable. Do **not** widen it to a range that untrusted clients can originate from — anyone
inside it can spoof their client address. Note that publishing the API port on the host (`5100:8080`
in the shipped compose file) lets a client reach the API *around* nginx from the bridge network, so
keep that port unpublished in any deployment where the trust set covers it.

## Session cookie `Secure` is configuration-driven

The 7-day `proxytrace_session` JWT cookie (`Proxytrace.Api/Auth/SessionCookie.cs`) is `HttpOnly`,
`SameSite=Strict`, and `Secure` **from configuration** — never inferred from `Request.IsHttps`, which
is `false` on the plain-HTTP hop behind the TLS-terminating proxy and would strip `Secure` from every
HTTPS installation's cookie, leaking the full session token on any plaintext request the browser can
be induced to make.

- Default: **on** everywhere except the `Development` environment (which `dev.sh` and
  `launchSettings.json` set), where the SPA and API are plain `http://`.
- Override: `Authentication:SessionCookie:Secure`. Set it to `false` only for a deliberate
  plain-HTTP deployment on a host that is **not** `localhost` — browsers treat `http://localhost` as
  a secure context and accept `Secure` cookies there, so the local Docker/e2e/kiosk stacks
  (`http://localhost:5101`) work with the default.

This setting is the mirror image of `ForwardedHeaders` / `RateLimiting` above: it is read from the
**container's** configuration view (`Proxytrace.Api/Module.cs`), the one that also sees
`appsettings.local.json`. That view must agree with the host about which environment this is, so the
environment name comes from `HostEnvironmentName` (`Proxytrace.Api/Configuration/`), which resolves
it exactly as `WebApplicationBuilder` does — **`DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT` ahead of
`ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT`**, from the process environment rather than from a JSON file — and the
module layers `appsettings.{Environment}.json` in between `appsettings.json` and
`appsettings.local.json`, where the host layers it. Both divergences were real: the reversed
precedence made a Production host compute `Development` (and drop `Secure`) when the two variables
were set and disagreed, and the missing environment file meant an operator's
`appsettings.Production.json` was silently ignored here while being honoured everywhere the host
config is read.

## In-process auth/MFA/rate-limit state is single-instance by design

Several auth defenses keep their state **in process memory**, not in a shared store:

- **MFA challenge tickets** (`MfaChallengeService`) — the short-lived two-step-login tickets and their
  per-ticket failed-attempt cap (see [`docs/mfa.md`](mfa.md)).
- **SSE stream tickets** (`StreamTicketService`).
- **Per-IP rate limiters** (`AuthRateLimiterConfigurator` in `Proxytrace.Api/Program.cs` — the
  `auth-login`, `auth-reset` and `auth-mfa` fixed-window policies). They partition on
  `Connection.RemoteIpAddress`, so they are only genuinely *per-IP* once the forwarded-header trust
  set above is declared; otherwise every client shares one bucket, which both weakens brute-force
  protection and lets one noisy client exhaust the window for everyone. Limits are overridable under
  `RateLimiting:{Login,PasswordReset,Mfa}:{PermitLimit,WindowSeconds}`:

  | Policy | Default | Endpoints |
  |---|---|---|
  | `auth-login` | 30 / minute | `login`, `claim-legacy`, `signup`, `invites/by-token/{token}` |
  | `auth-reset` | 10 / 15 min | `forgot-password`, `reset-password` |
  | `auth-mfa` | 10 / 15 min | `mfa/verify` |

  There is **no per-account failed-attempt counter or lockout**; the `auth-login` window is the only
  bound on online password guessing, so it is sized to swallow a human fumbling a password (and a
  shared-NAT office signing in) while cutting an unthrottled attack by three-plus orders of magnitude.

This is correct for the **documented single-instance topology**: the API runs as exactly one replica
(both the split and kiosk deployment shapes run a single API process — see
[`../manual/admin/deployment.md`](../manual/admin/deployment.md)). It is **not** a bug. If you ever
scale the API horizontally these caps/limiters/tickets would partition per replica (each instance
enforces its own counters, and a ticket minted on one replica is unknown to another), weakening the
brute-force and attempt-cap guarantees. Scaling out is therefore **not supported as-is**; it would
require moving this state into the shared **Redis** the split deployment already runs (the event
broker), and is deliberately out of scope today. Do **not** silently add a second API replica behind a
load balancer without that work.

## Repository secret hygiene (gitleaks)

The repo is scanned for committed credentials with [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks);
config lives in `.gitleaks.toml` (default rules + an allowlist of the fake fixture credentials that
are committed on purpose — the test-signed e2e support-key JWT, demo-data keys, test strings).

- **Pre-commit hook** — `scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit` scans staged changes and blocks the commit on
  a finding. Enable once per clone with `./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh` (sets `core.hooksPath`);
  requires gitleaks on `PATH` (skips with a warning otherwise). One-off bypass:
  `GITLEAKS_SKIP=1 git commit ...`.
- **CI** — the `secrets` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` scans the full history on every push/PR
  and at the release gate.
- A finding is a real problem: remove the secret and rotate it. Only extend the `.gitleaks.toml`
  allowlist for deliberately committed fakes, never to silence a real credential.

## Code scanning & dependency updates

- **CodeQL** — `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` runs GitHub code scanning on every PR, push to
  master, and a weekly cron (so new query-pack releases surface findings without a commit).
  Languages: C# (build-mode `none` — no compilation), JavaScript/TypeScript, and GitHub Actions
  workflows. Alerts land in the repo's Security tab; a PR fails its CodeQL check when it
  introduces new alerts.
- **Dependabot** — `.github/dependabot.yml` opens weekly version-update PRs for nuget (`/`),
  npm (`frontend/`, `e2e/`, `manual/`), github-actions, and the three Dockerfiles. Minor+patch
  updates are grouped into one PR per ecosystem; majors arrive individually. Dependabot security
  updates (vulnerability-driven PRs) are enabled in the repo settings. Every Dependabot PR runs
  the normal ci + e2e gates.

  Bumps we have evaluated and rejected are recorded as `ignore:` entries in that file, each
  annotated with the reason and the condition for removing it. Record a rejection there rather
  than with an `@dependabot ignore ...` comment: the comment command is rejected on a grouped
  PR ("the command you entered is not valid for this pull request"), so it fails silently and
  the bump comes back on the next run. The `triage-dependency-prs` skill walks the queue.

## Out of scope

`StoredLicense` JWT is left plaintext: it is a signed license token, not a credential, so encrypting
it adds migration + decrypt-on-startup cost for no real secrecy gain. `User.PasswordHash` is already
hashed via `IPasswordService`. Automated key rotation / bulk re-encryption tooling is deliberately
not implemented.

(A keyed-HMAC blind index *was* previously listed here as out of scope. It is now implemented for the
one value that needed it — the operator-entered upstream provider key — because the "these are all
256-bit CSPRNG secrets" justification never applied to that one. See the blind-index section above.
The remaining indexes stay unkeyed, and that is correct for them.)
