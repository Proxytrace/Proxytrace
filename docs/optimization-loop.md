# The Optimization Loop

Proxytrace's core feedback loop turns curated traces into validated, evidence-backed agent
improvements:

```
TestSuite (+ TestCases)
      │  ITestRunnerService.RunInBackgroundAsync
      ▼
TestRunGroup ── one TestRun per endpoint ── each TestCase → TestResult (scored by evaluators)
      │  on completion: IOptimizerService.EnqueueAsync(group)
      ▼
Optimizers discover OptimizationTheory hypotheses   (also: external producers via POST /api/theories)
      │  ITheoryValidationService.SubmitAsync  (dedup + per-project quota)
      ▼
A/B validation ── baseline run vs candidate run, back to back, same suite ── two-proportion test
      │  win (improvement beyond noise)   │  loss / no significant win   │  validation errored
      ▼                                   ▼                              ▼

      │  human review on the Proposals review desk
      ▼
 Accepted (promoted → handoff package for the developer)  /  Rejected
      │  ProposalAdoptionService watches ingested traffic for the exact change
      ▼
 Adopted (change observed live in the agent, or confirmed manually)
```

Proxytrace is an observing proxy — it cannot change the client's actual system prompt, tools,
or model. Promoting a proposal therefore does **not** apply anything; it hands the change to
the developer (copy buttons, a markdown handoff doc, and `GET /api/proposals/{id}/artifact`)
and arms adoption tracking (Stage 5).

The user-facing description of this loop lives in `manual/guide/optimization-theories.md`,
`manual/guide/running-tests.md`, and `manual/guide/optimization-proposals.md` — keep those in
sync when the loop changes.

## Stage 1 — Run a suite

A **`TestSuite`** holds curated **`TestCase`** inputs and an N:M set of **`IEvaluator`**s. A `TestCase`
is created three ways, all preserving provenance where one exists: **promoted** from a trace as-is
(expected output = the response the agent recorded), **corrected** from a trace (the agent's input, but
a human-supplied expected output — "the right answer was X", which turns a rejected output into a
regression test), or **synthetic** (raw input + expected output, no source). Promoted and corrected
cases carry `ITestCase.SourceAgentCallId` — a denormalized link back to the source `AgentCall` — so the
chain `trace → case` stays answerable; synthetic cases carry `null`. Both the REST seam
(`POST /api/test-suites/{id}/test-cases`) and the MCP `add_trace_to_suite` tool expose the correction
path (see [`mcp.md`](mcp.md)).

**A promotion or correction can also be agent-proposed.** A multi-turn conversation is several
`AgentCall`s sharing one `ConversationId`, and one case per turn is rarely what anyone wants — the
turns worth testing are the few where the agent *decided* something. `ITestCaseSynthesisService`
(`Proxytrace.Application/TestCase/`) reads the whole conversation, hands a budgeted transcript to a
system agent on the project's `SystemEndpoint` (prompt `test_case_synthesizer`), and returns ranked
proposals over `POST /api/agent-calls/{id}/test-case-proposals`. The proposals are **ephemeral** —
no entity, no migration; they are reviewed in the trace detail's *Generate tests* panel (or via
Tracey's `propose_test_cases`) and written through the ordinary endpoints above, so every case is
still a plain promotion or correction underneath. Nothing the model says is trusted:
`ProposalValidator` re-checks every `agentCallId` against the real conversation, drops a call with no
response, and flags the traps below rather than hiding them.

**The synthesis call asks for no reasoning.** A user watches a panel block on this single model
call, and on a reasoning model the hidden thinking dwarfs the answer: measured against a four-call
conversation, one round spent 1.7k–3.0k reasoning tokens to produce a ~300-token JSON answer and
took 25–44s, where asking for none returned the same proposals in 8–13s. So
`TestCaseSynthesisService` passes `ModelOptions` with `ReasoningEffort = "none"` rather than the
`null` options that let the provider's default apply. This is a request, never a requirement — a
model with no such knob rejects the parameter — OpenAI answers it with a 400 on a gpt-4o-class
model, and an o-series model refuses a level it does not implement — and `ModelClient` retries once
without it, so the answer is slower, not absent. Only a 400 that names the parameter earns that
retry, so a genuinely malformed request still fails on the first try rather than being sent twice.
It is scoped to this agent on purpose: the judges and optimizers are
background work where thinking may be worth its latency, and turning it off for them is a separate
quality decision, not a free win.

Two things had to be true for that to work at all, and only one of them was. `ModelSamplingParameters`
carries the value, but `ChatClientExtensions` used to put it in `ChatOptions.AdditionalProperties`,
which the `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` OpenAI adapter **silently discards** — so no sampling parameter
without a first-class `ChatOptions` member ever reached a provider, and the playground's
Reasoning-effort control did nothing at all. It now travels via
`ChatOptions.RawRepresentationFactory` onto the OpenAI SDK's own options type, which the adapter
starts from and only partially overwrites. Assert this kind of thing against the **outgoing request
body**, not against `ChatOptions`: a test that reads the mapping cannot tell "the provider was told"
from "a dictionary was filled and thrown away", which is exactly how this survived. Nothing may be
routed through `AdditionalProperties` at all — `ToChatOptions_WithSamplingParameters_PutsThemOnThe-
Wire` reads the bytes for every sampling override.

Choice count (`n`) is the one control that was **removed** rather than repaired
([#496](https://github.com/NordsteinSoftware/Proxytrace/issues/496)). It can be put on the wire — the
OpenAI SDK's `JsonPatch` escape hatch reaches fields it exposes no property for — but nothing
downstream can use the answer: `StreamingChatCompletionUpdate` carries **no choice index**, so every
completion's tokens arrive flattened into one indistinguishable stream. Sending an `n` would bill
for N completions and render them interleaved into a single garbled playground message, which is a
worse bug than the silent drop it replaced. `ModelSamplingParameters` therefore has no choice-count
member and the playground offers no such control. Rendering N completions properly is a feature
(a per-choice channel through `ModelStreamUpdate`, the SSE frames, and the UI), not a mapping fix.

**An errored evaluator is not a failing case.** `TestResultExtensions.IsPass` — the canonical verdict,
mirrored in the frontend by `lib/runResults.ts` — passes a result when at least one evaluation
produced a verdict and every such verdict passed. Evaluations that **errored** are excluded from the
verdict rather than counted as failures: a judge that crashed or answered unparseably says nothing
about the agent, and folding it in makes a broken evaluator indistinguishable from a real defect,
dragging the run's pass rate down and biasing the two-proportion A/B test that reads it. A result
whose evaluations *all* errored has no verdict and still does not pass. The judge side is hardened to
match: an agentic evaluator's `Reasoning` carries an explicit length budget in the schema it is
prompted with, a failed judge call is retried once, and a verdict truncated mid-string is repaired
and re-parsed (`TruncatedJsonRepair`) rather than discarded over its prose.

**A case scores one model call — so promote the decision, not the summary.** `RunTestCase` calls
`IModelClient.CompleteAsync(testCase.Input)` **exactly once** and never continues the tool loop
(`TestRunnerService.cs`), so a case only ever grades the next assistant message. A promoted or
corrected case's input is `agentCall.Request` verbatim (`TestCase`'s `CreateNewFromCall` /
`CreateCorrection`), and an agent *turn* that uses tools is **several** `AgentCall`s sharing one
`ConversationId` — each capturing the conversation as it stood. Promote the **last** one and the input
already holds every tool call the agent made *and* every result it got; the only producible output is
the closing summary. A **correction** there is unpassable by construction: when the harmful call
already succeeded in the input, no expected output that contradicts that result can be generated, and
the case fails forever while reading as "the prompt fix did not work". Correct instead the call whose
own *response* contains the wrong tool call — its request stops at the decision point, so the fix has
somewhere to land.

`Conversation.ResolvedToolCallCount` counts the tool calls an input already resolved (paired by
tool-call id) and surfaces as `TestCaseDto.ResolvedToolCallCount`; anything above zero means the case
grades a summary. `add_trace_to_suite` says so in its tool description, and Tracey's
`create_suite` / `add_to_suite` return an `unpassableCases` report when a correction lands on such an
input — see [`../frontend/docs/TRACEY.md`](../frontend/docs/TRACEY.md). Straight promotions are not
flagged: they assert the response the agent actually gave, which agrees with their own input by
construction.

The synthesis path checks the same thing machine-side: `ProposalValidator` marks a proposed
correction on such an input `ProposalFlag.Unpassable`, the panel explains the trap in place, and the
proposal is never pre-selected. The `test_case_synthesizer` prompt is also told to build the case
from the call whose own *response* holds the decision, so the trap is avoided before it is flagged.

`ITestRunnerService` executes the suite:

- `RunInBackgroundAsync(suite, endpoints, scheduleId, sampleCount)` — creates a **`TestRunGroup`**
  with **`sampleCount` `TestRun`s per endpoint** (model comparison × sampling), queues them, returns
  immediately. A suite may target **at most `ITestRunGroup.MaxModelEndpoints` (3) endpoints** and
  **`ITestRunGroup.MaxSampleCount` (5) samples** per endpoint — both hard caps enforced in
  `CreateGroup` (throws), in the controllers (400), and (endpoints only) in `TestRunSchedule.Validate`;
  the UI caps selection to match. So a group holds up to 3 × 5 = **15 runs**. Each `TestRun` carries a
  zero-based `SampleIndex`; the group carries the requested `SampleCount` (1 for single-sample runs).
  Runs sharing an endpoint form a **cohort** — averaged in the results UI and reduced to one
  representative run for this loop (see below). Scheduled runs always use `sampleCount = 1`;
  A/B validation uses `OptimizationOptions.AbSampleCount`.
- `RunInForegroundAsync(..., sampleCount, ...)` — synchronous run; used internally (A/B validation)
  and in tests. Takes `customAgent` and an `isSystemTestRun` flag that **hides internal A/B runs**
  from the user's run list.
- Each `TestCase` produces a **`TestResult`** scored by the suite's evaluators. Live progress
  streams over SSE via `ITestResultBroadcaster`. A case whose inference or evaluation throws is
  **skipped** (logged, the run carries on) and therefore produces no result at all.
- A run reaches a terminal state through `FinishRun`, once every case has been *attempted* —
  `Completed` when all of them produced a result, **`Failed`** when any were skipped. Completion is
  deliberately not inferred from the result count alone: a skipped case can never reach that count,
  which used to strand the run in `Running` for the lifetime of the process while its group already
  read `Completed`. A `Failed` run is *visibly* incomplete, and the A/B validators refuse to score it
  either way (`IsRunComplete` compares result count against suite size).
- The runner's work queue and in-flight state are **in-memory only**, so a process restart mid-run
  strands those groups in `Running`/`Pending` (they can't be resumed). `OrphanedTestRunReaperHostedService`
  runs on startup and marks every non-terminal group and its non-terminal runs **`Cancelled`**
  (via `ITestRunGroupRepository.GetByStatusesAsync`), then sweeps any run still non-terminal under an
  already-terminal group (via `ITestRunRepository.GetByStatusAsync`) — the group-scoped query cannot
  see those. Mirrors how theory validation re-reconciles its in-memory queue on boot. Idempotent — a
  clean shutdown leaves nothing to reap.

Runs can be kicked off **manually** (the API/UI) or on a **schedule**. A `TestRunSchedule` (a
domain entity binding a suite to a fixed set of endpoints — capped at 3, like manual runs — + a
cadence) is polled by
`TestRunSchedulerService` — a `BackgroundService` on a ~60s `PeriodicTimer`, disabled in kiosk —
which fires `RunInBackgroundAsync(suite, endpoints, scheduleId)` for each due/enabled
schedule (skipping any whose prior run is still in flight, then advancing `NextRunAt` so missed
ticks collapse). The resulting `TestRunGroup` therefore carries a `ScheduleId`; scheduled runs
feed every downstream stage of this loop exactly like manual ones.

| Concern | File |
|---|---|
| Run orchestration | `Proxytrace.Application/TestRun/Internal/TestRunnerService.cs` (`ITestRunnerService`) |
| Scheduled triggers | `Proxytrace.Application/TestRun/Internal/TestRunSchedulerService.cs` (`BackgroundService`) |
| Run config (concurrency etc.) | `Proxytrace.Application/TestRun/TestRunnerConfiguration.cs` |
| Live results SSE | `Proxytrace.Application/Streaming/Internal/TestResultBroadcaster.cs` |
| Aggregate stats | `Proxytrace.Application/Statistics/TestRun/Internal/TestRunStatsProjector.cs` |
| Run → DTO (incl. latency) | `Proxytrace.Api/Dto/TestRuns/TestRunDtoMapper.cs` |
| API entry | `Proxytrace.Api/Controllers/TestRunGroupsController.cs` |
| Domain entities | `Proxytrace.Domain/{TestSuite,TestCase,TestRunGroup,TestRun,TestResult}/` |

**A run's "latency" is the model's inference latency, aggregated across cases — never a wall-clock
run timer.** Each `TestResult.Latency` is a `Stopwatch` around the single model call
(`ModelClient.CompleteAsync`), excluding evaluators. Everything that reports run latency derives
from those per-case values: `TestRunStats.TotalDuration` sums them, the anomaly detector and
`TheoryValidatorBase.Metrics` use the sum/mean, and the API DTO mappers expose `DurationMs` as their
**average** via the shared `RunLatency.AverageInferenceMs` helper (the run cards and the proposal
A/B-test card both go through it, so the surfaces can't drift). A wall-clock `CompletedAt − CreatedAt`
measure would fold in the run's queue wait, the evaluator passes, and the parallel-execution overlap
between cases, so it is deliberately **not** used for latency.

When a group completes, `TestRunnerService.ExecuteGroupAsync` calls
`IOptimizerService.EnqueueAsync(group)`. `TestRunGroupsController` can also enqueue on demand.

The same completion point also feeds **anomaly detection** (a parallel, independent pipeline — see
below): `TestRunnerService` calls `IAnomalyDetectionService.EnqueueAsync(group)` on both the success
and the failure path (a failed group is itself the most important anomaly). Anomaly detection raises
user notifications rather than theories; it does not participate in the theory→proposal loop.

**Each path only settles a group it actually settled.** Both the success path and the generic
failure handler check `group.Status.IsTerminal()` under the per-group lock and do their terminal
work — the `SetCompleted`/`SetFailed` transition, the `PublishGroupComplete` broadcast, *and* the
enqueues — only when that check let them through. A group is settled exactly once, by exactly one
of them, so it gets exactly **one** terminal SSE event and **one** anomaly-detection pass. This
matters because the failure handler is reachable with the group already terminal: a racing
`CancelAsync` may have settled it `Cancelled`, or the fault may have come from the *tail* of the
success path (an enqueue) with the group already `Completed`. Broadcasting or enqueueing from there
re-sent the terminal event carrying the state the group was already in rather than `Failed`, and
re-ran detection, so one genuine anomaly was flagged and notified twice (#486).
`Proxytrace.Application/Anomaly/` holds `IAnomalyDetectionService` (a hosted background queue, a
structural copy of `OptimizerService`), the pure `IAnomalyDetector` rule engine (run failed /
endpoint unavailable, pass-rate drop or latency increase vs a rolling baseline computed from
`TestRunStats`), `IAnomalyInputFactory` (assembles a group's `AnomalyInput` — cohorts + rolling
baseline — shared with the kiosk demo seeder, which runs the same rule engine over its seeded
incident groups), and `AnomalyDetectionConfiguration` (thresholds + baseline window). Detected
anomalies are delivered through `INotificationService` → the dashboard notification channel.

**Both enqueues are handed `CancellationToken.None`, deliberately.** The group's transition to a
terminal state happens *inside* the per-group `IAsyncLock`, but the two `EnqueueAsync` calls run
outside it. Passing the run's linked (cancellable) token there opened a silent hole: a `CancelAsync`
landing in that window tripped the token, both enqueues were skipped, and `SettleCancelledAsync` then
found an already-terminal group and no-op'd — so the group read `Completed` forever with neither
optimization nor anomaly detection ever run, and no error surfaced (#476). Once a group is durably
terminal the downstream jobs are **owed**, so they must not be cancellable by a racing cancel. Keep
it that way on both the success and the failure path.

**Sampling and the loop — cohort aggregation.** The per-run `TestRunStats` projection is left
**unchanged** (one row per `TestRun`); the loop aggregates at read time so N samples never produce N
near-identical anomalies or bias a proposal toward "sample 0":

- `Proxytrace.Application/TestRun/RunCohort.cs` groups a group's runs by endpoint and resolves, per
  cohort, a **representative run** — the **median sample by pass count** (tie → lowest `SampleIndex`;
  fallback to a completed sample before stats project) — plus mean stats across the samples.
- Both **optimizers** (`CompositeOptimizer` builds the cohorts once and hands `IReadOnlyList<RunCohort>`
  to each `IOptimizerImplementation`) and **anomaly detection** consume cohorts: one input/proposal per
  endpoint, off the representative + cohort mean.
- The anomaly **baseline** (`AnomalyDetectionService.BuildBaselineAsync`) groups prior `TestRunStats` by
  `GroupId`, averages each prior group's samples to one point, then takes the last `BaselineWindow`
  **groups** — so one prior sampled run counts once in the rolling window.
- Read-time consumers that report "one result per endpoint per group" (suite run aggregates, the
  dashboard pass-rate sparkline, an agent's latest suite pass rates) call
  `TestRunStatsCohortExtensions.AggregateSamples`, which collapses only the sample dimension.

## Stage 2 — Discover theories

`IOptimizerService` (a hosted background service) hands the completed group to `IOptimizer`.
`CompositeOptimizer` fans out to every `IOptimizerImplementation`, each producing unproven
**`IOptimizationTheory`** hypotheses (Kind = system-prompt / tool-update / model-switch):

| Optimizer | File |
|---|---|
| Composite fan-out | `Optimization/Internal/CompositeOptimizer.cs` |
| Prompt rewrite | `Optimization/Internal/UpdateSystemPromptOptimizer.cs` |
| Tool definition change | `Optimization/Internal/UpdateToolDefinitionOptimizer.cs` |
| Model switch | `Optimization/Internal/SwitchModelOptimizer.cs` |
| Queue + dispatch | `Optimization/Internal/OptimizerService.cs` (`IOptimizerService`) |

A theory is **just a hypothesis** at this point — not persisted, not validated. The optimizer
submits each via `ITheoryValidationService.SubmitAsync`. External producers (users, Tracey AI,
API callers) submit the same way through `Proxytrace.Api/Controllers/TheoriesController.cs`
(`POST /api/theories`), so every theory flows through one pipeline.

## Stage 3 — Validate via A/B run

`TheoryValidationService` (hosted background service) deduplicates, enforces the per-project
concurrent-validation quota (`TheorySubmissionOutcome`: `Accepted` / `Duplicate` /
`QuotaExceeded`), then routes the theory to the matching `ITheoryValidator`. The queue itself
is in-memory; on startup the service re-queues every theory still `Proposed`/`Validating`
(`IOptimizationTheoryRepository.GetActiveAsync`) so a restart cannot strand the backlog.
Recovery is skipped in kiosk mode: kiosk storage is in-memory and freshly demo-seeded on
every boot, so the only backlog it could find is the seeded `Proposed` demo theories —
re-queuing those would trigger real A/B runs (LLM spend) on every kiosk start when a live
`Kiosk:Endpoint` is configured. The flip side is that a seeded theory never advances, so
the demo seed leaves **no** theory in `Validating`: it would render as a permanently
pulsing "A/B in flight" row. Theories submitted during a kiosk session still validate
normally via `SubmitAsync`:

| Validator | File |
|---|---|
| Pipeline + queue + quota | `Optimization/Internal/TheoryValidationService.cs` (`ITheoryValidationService`) |
| Shared A/B flow (ephemeral candidate agent) | `Optimization/Internal/Validation/AbTestTheoryValidator.cs` |
| Validator base | `Optimization/Internal/Validation/TheoryValidatorBase.cs` |
| System-prompt theory | `.../Validation/SystemPromptTheoryValidator.cs` |
| Tool-update theory | `.../Validation/ToolUpdateTheoryValidator.cs` |
| Model-switch theory | `.../Validation/ModelSwitchTheoryValidator.cs` |
| Paired significance test / p-value | `.../Validation/ProportionStats.cs` |
| Evidence assembly | `Optimization/Internal/Evidence/OptimizerEvidenceBuilder.cs` |

Validation runs the **baseline and candidate fresh, back to back**, against the same suite and
the agent's current state — so the only difference is the proposed change (reusing an older run
would conflate the change with agent drift while the theory waited in the queue). For prompt/tool
kinds the candidate is an **ephemeral agent** built by the validator; for model switches it is the
agent on the alternate endpoint. The candidate run is linked to the theory while still in flight
via the `CandidateRunObserver` callback, and is flagged `isSystemTestRun` so it stays out of the
user's run list.

Each arm runs `OptimizationOptions.AbSampleCount` times (default **3**). The cost is proportional —
each extra sample is another full suite run per arm.

#### The significance test is paired on the test case, not pooled over replays

This is worth understanding before changing anything here, because the obvious implementation is
wrong in a direction that always errs toward accepting.

The samples used to be **pooled**: passes and totals summed across replays, then fed to a
two-proportion test. That treats `cases × replays` as that many independent trials — but replays of
the *same* test case are not independent of each other, and a case that deterministically passes
contributes the identical outcome every time. The sample size was therefore inflated by the replay
count and the standard error shrank by roughly √(replays), so **the gate got easier to pass the more
samples an operator configured** — exactly backwards, and it meant raising `AbSampleCount` quietly
bought acceptances rather than confidence.

The unit of independence is the **test case**, and both arms run the same ones, so the analysis is
**paired**: per case, take the difference in pass proportion across its replays and test whether the
mean difference differs from zero — a paired t-test with n = the number of test cases. Replays still
earn their keep (they sharpen each case's proportion, narrowing the spread of the differences) but
they no longer manufacture sample size. Because n is routinely well under 30, the test uses the
**t distribution**, not the normal approximation, whose thinner tails would understate the p-value
and reintroduce the same over-acceptance.

Two consequences to keep in mind:

- **Pass rates are still reported pooled** ("of everything attempted, this fraction passed"), which
  is what a reader expects to see. Only the *verdict* is paired. Do not feed `SumPassCounts` to a
  significance test — use `PairedPassRates`.
- **A p-value can be undefined**, and that is meaningful rather than missing: fewer than two paired
  cases (one case cannot evidence a difference between arms), or no difference in any case. Where
  every case moves the same way by exactly the same amount, the t statistic is unbounded and the
  test falls back to the two-sided **sign test** — ten cases all flipping to passing gives p ≈ 0.002,
  while two cases agreeing gives 0.5, which is the honest reading of a coin toss.

An 11-case suite improving 5/11 → 8/11 is three cases flipping, and lands at p ≈ 0.08 — suggestive
but unproven, at one sample per arm or at three. That is the correct answer; the previous pooled
figure of 15/33 → 24/33 "reaching significance" was an artefact of counting the same evidence three
times.

#### Both queues survive a restart

The optimizer queue and the theory queue are both **in-process channels**, so a restart discards
whatever is still in them. Each therefore re-queues its backlog on start, from a durable marker:

| Queue | Marker | Recovery |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory validation | `TheoryStatus` (Proposed/Validating) | `TheoryValidationService.RecoverInFlightTheoriesAsync` |
| Optimizer (theory discovery) | `ITestRunGroup.OptimizationConsideredAt` | `OptimizerService.RecoverPendingGroupsAsync` |

The group marker exists solely for this: without it there was nothing to distinguish "never
considered" from "considered and produced no theories", so a deploy during a scheduled-run window
silently dropped that night's optimization. It is set **after** the theories are submitted, so a
crash mid-discovery leaves the group pending and retries it; and it is set **even when discovery
found nothing**, or every barren group would be reprocessed on every boot forever.

Two guards worth preserving when touching this:

- **Recovery is capped** (50 groups per start, remainder deferred and logged), so a long-dormant
  install does not enqueue its entire history — and its entire LLM cost — on the first start after
  upgrading. For the same reason the migration that added the column **backfills existing rows as
  already considered**: history is not a backlog.
- **Recovery is skipped in kiosk mode**, exactly as the theory queue's is — kiosk storage is
  in-memory and demo-seeded on every start, so its only "backlog" is the seed.

The outcome (`TheoryValidationOutcome`) records baseline pass rate, projected pass rate, p-value,
and candidate run id **regardless of result**:
- **Won** — improvement is real (beyond sampling noise: the paired p-value must be
  ≤ `OptimizationOptions.SignificanceLevel` = 0.05) → spawns a **Draft `OptimizationProposal`**
  carrying the A/B comparison as evidence. Model-switch theories instead require *no* pass-rate
  regression plus a genuine cost or latency win — equal-quality-but-pricier is not a win.
  **Their evidence gate is directional and deliberately different:** a model switch claims *parity*
  on quality, so demanding a statistically significant *difference* would be backwards — it would
  reject the ideal result (identical answers, materially cheaper) and admit only switches that
  measurably changed the output. A null p-value there usually means the arms agreed on every case,
  which is the best outcome available. What is gated instead is the *size of the paired comparison*
  (at least two paired cases), so parity is never concluded from evidence that could not have shown
  a difference at all.
- **Rejected** — the A/B ran cleanly but showed no significant improvement → theory marked
  Invalidated; metrics still kept so the same idea isn't retried (dedup).
- **Could not test** — the comparison never happened: a run was incomplete (unreachable/unauthorized
  provider, upstream outage, per-case inference errors) or the validation threw → theory marked
  **Failed** (`TheoryStatus.Failed`, audit `TheoryValidationFailed`), with no metrics but any linked
  A/B run preserved for diagnosis. A Failed theory is *unproven, not disproven*: it is **excluded
  from the review desk's win rate**, surfaced in its own "Needs attention" queue group instead of
  History, does **not** suppress an identical resubmission (dedup treats it like Invalidated), and
  can be retried (reset) or dismissed (reject → Invalidated without metrics).

### Tuning validation (`OptimizationOptions`)

Bound from the `Optimization` configuration section (`Proxytrace.Api/Module.cs`), with a
`PreserveExistingDefaults()` fallback in `Optimization/Module.cs` so hosts that bind no
configuration — tests, tooling — still resolve it:

| Setting | Default | Effect |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `AbSampleCount` | `3` | Runs per arm (max `ITestRunGroup.MaxSampleCount`). Sharpens each case's pass proportion; does **not** increase the significance test's sample size — see above. |
| `SignificanceLevel` | `0.05` | Maximum two-sided paired p-value that counts as a real difference. |
| `RequireStatisticalSignificance` | `true` | When false, beating the baseline is enough — the p-value is still computed and stored. |

`OptimizationOptions.KioskShowcase` is the one place the gate is dropped: the demo runs one sample
per arm so Step 7 finishes in front of an audience, and its real-but-small effect straddles any
fixed threshold. The frontend labels such a proposal **"improvement only"** rather than
"significant" (`theoryQueue.significanceLabel`), so a relaxed gate is never presented as proof it
isn't. Never relax either setting for a real installation: a false positive means shipping a prompt
change that did nothing.

## Stage 4 — Proposal review

An **`OptimizationProposal`** has `Kind`, `Status` (`Draft`/`Accepted`/`Adopted`/`Rejected`),
`Priority`, `Rationale`, typed payloads (`SystemPromptProposal`, `ToolUpdateProposal`,
`ModelSwitchProposal`), and `EvidenceTestRunIds`. Status changes are **domain transitions**
(`Accept()`, `Reject()` from Draft; `MarkAdopted()` from Accepted) — the API's
`PATCH /api/proposals/{id}/status` returns 409 for anything else. Theories and proposals stream
to the **Proposals** review desk over SSE via `IProposalBroadcaster` (`proposal-created`,
`proposal-status-changed`) and `ITheoryBroadcaster`.

**Promote = handoff, not auto-apply.** On promote the UI offers the handoff package: copy
buttons for the proposed prompt / tools JSON / model name, a client-generated markdown
"apply this change" doc, and the machine-readable artifact endpoint
`GET /api/proposals/{id}/artifact`.

`ITheoryValidationService` also supports **resetting** a terminal theory (Validated, Invalidated,
or Failed) for re-validation (`TheoryResetOutcome`) — refused if the spawned proposal was already
Accepted or Adopted (`BlockedByAcceptedProposal`). For a Failed theory the review desk offers this
as **Retry validation**.

It also supports **rejecting** a theory on user request (`RejectAsync` →
`TheoryRejectOutcome`, `POST /api/theories/{id}/reject`): a `Proposed` theory is dismissed without
ever running A/B validation; a `Validating` theory has its in-flight A/B run cancelled; a `Failed`
theory is filed away without a retry. All land in
`Invalidated` with no A/B metrics — the absence of metrics (`Reject()` on the entity) is what
distinguishes a manual dismissal from an A/B-disproven invalidation (the review-desk copies adapt
accordingly). Cancellation works because each validation registers a per-theory
`CancellationTokenSource` (linked to the service stopping token) around the validator call;
cancelling it aborts the candidate/baseline run through the test runner's linked-token path. A
`Proposed` theory still queued is simply transitioned and skipped when the serial worker reaches it.

**Validation is serial.** `TheoryValidationService` is a singleton hosted worker draining a
single-reader channel with a sequential `await` loop, and each validation runs baseline then
candidate back-to-back — so **at most one A/B run executes at a time** process-wide. The
`MaxInFlightPerProject` quota bounds only the queued backlog, not parallelism. (Horizontal scaling to
multiple replicas would need a distributed lease in `RecoverInFlightTheoriesAsync` to preserve this;
the current deployment is single-process.)

| Concern | File |
|---|---|
| Proposal SSE | `Streaming/Internal/ProposalBroadcaster.cs` |
| Theory SSE | `Streaming/Internal/TheoryBroadcaster.cs` |
| Proposal / theory entities | `Proxytrace.Domain/{OptimizationProposal,OptimizationTheory}/` |
| Artifact endpoint + status transitions | `Proxytrace.Api/Controllers/ProposalsController.cs` |
| DI wiring (optimizers, validators, hosted services) | `Proxytrace.Application/Optimization/Module.cs` |

## Stage 5 — Adoption tracking

After promotion, **`ProposalAdoptionService`** (hosted service,
`Optimization/Internal/Adoption/`) watches `IEntityEventService` and flips an Accepted proposal
to **Adopted** when the change shows up — exactly — in the agent's live state:

- **new `IAgentVersion`** (ingestion detected a prompt/tool change) → exact prompt string /
  tool-set match against the proposed change; the proposal records the version
  (`AdoptedAgentVersionId`/`Number`, "Adopted in v{N}").
- **`IAgent` updated** (ingestion flipped the endpoint) → endpoint match for ModelSwitch
  proposals.
- **proposal promoted** → immediate check against the agent's current state (covers "already
  applied before promoting").
- **startup sweep** over all Accepted proposals heals events missed while down.

Matching is deliberately exact (`ProposalAdoptionMatcher`); a tweaked adoption is confirmed by
the human **Mark adopted** action (`PATCH … status: Adopted`, sets `AdoptedManually`). Known
auto-detection gaps — reverting to an already-stored old version (no new-version event) and
traffic attributed to a different agent — are covered by Mark adopted; the handoff doc
recommends pinning attribution with the `X-Proxytrace-Agent` header.
