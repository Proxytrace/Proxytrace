 * The agent's proposal for how to SCORE these cases, approved separately from the cases themselves.
 *
 * A suite's evaluators apply to every case in it and a case passes only when EVERY attached
 * evaluator passes, so attaching a judge is never a local change. The card says that out loud
 * rather than letting the user discover it in the next run.
 *
 * The three answers are a radio list rather than a segmented control, and each carries its
 * consequence permanently. A segmented control reads as "interchangeable views of one thing", which
 * these are not: one of them widens what the destination suite grades, and one quietly sends the
 * cases somewhere other than the suite picked at the top of the panel. Showing every consequence at
 * once is what lets the choice be compared instead of discovered — the old card revealed the blast
 * radius only *after* the option was selected, and never mentioned the redirect at all.
