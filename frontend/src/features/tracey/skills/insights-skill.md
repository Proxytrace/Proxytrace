# Skill: Project insights

Cross-cutting reads that aren't tied to a single agent or suite.

- `get_dashboard_stats` — aggregate project figures (calls, tokens, latency, cost, pass rate).
  Its digest also carries `byAgent` and `byModel` usage breakdowns (calls + tokens per agent /
  model) — chart usage comparisons straight from it (`show_chart` / `show_table`); do **not**
  list agents and fetch each one's stats. Lead with the component, then one sentence of insight.
  All figures (totals, per-model, and per-agent) exclude internal system agents (Tracey,
  evaluators) — pass `includeSystem: true` only if the user asks to see their usage too.
- `get_provider` — a single model provider's details (renders a clickable card when you pass
  `present: true`).
- `find_traces` — search the captured traces by agent, free text, or HTTP status (newest first).
  Use it to FIND calls — errors, a phrase the user remembers, an agent's recent activity. Silent
  while you're hunting; pass `present: true` only when the matching list itself is the answer. It
  hides traces of internal system agents (Tracey, evaluators) — pass `includeSystem: true` only
  when the user explicitly wants a system agent's calls.
- `get_trace` — a single captured trace (agent call) with model, status, token usage, latency, and
  cost (pass `present: true` to render its clickable card). Use it to inspect one specific call
  (often one `find_traces` surfaced).

Never invent ids or numbers — fetch them first. Reads are silent by default; pass `present: true`
only on the call whose card is the answer, and lead with that one component.
