# Tracey — implementation guide

How the in-app **Tracey AI** assistant works on the frontend. Read this before changing anything
in `frontend/src/features/tracey/`. It is the source of truth for the chat architecture. Sibling
docs: [`./DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md) (visual system) and [`./BEST_PRACTICES.md`](./BEST_PRACTICES.md)
(code architecture). The backend side (call attribution, agent seeding) and the design decisions
behind the harder pieces live in the specs under
[`../../docs/superpowers/specs/`](../../docs/superpowers/specs/) —
`*-tracey-client-agent-design.md` (the planes + name attribution),
`*-tracey-proactive-await-actions-design.md` (`await_actions`), and
`*-tracey-tool-result-store-design.md` (the artifact store). User-facing behavior lives in
[`../../manual/guide/tracey.md`](../../manual/guide/tracey.md).

All paths below are relative to the feature root `frontend/src/features/tracey/` unless noted.

## What Tracey is

A conversational agent rendered on the full-page **Tracey AI** route. She reads the project's live
state, navigates the user, searches the product manual, runs a curated set of read/write actions,
and renders rich **inline UI** in the chat thread (charts/tables/text, entity cards, choice
prompts). Her own LLM calls are routed back through Proxytrace and captured as traces — she is the
platform's first dogfood agent.

Her **defining trait: she shows, she doesn't narrate.** Tools render interactive UI inline; the
ideal reply is a rendered component plus one short sentence of context, never a paragraph of
numbers. This is enforced by `TRACEY_SYSTEM_PROMPT` (`tracey-prompt.ts`) and by every read tool
returning only a compact digest to the model while the full payload is rendered to the user.

## The two planes (the one mental model that matters)

Tracey runs on two independent request paths. Keep them separate in your head:

1. **Reasoning plane (LLM).** The Vercel **AI SDK v6** drives the chat. It POSTs OpenAI-shape
   `/chat/completions` requests to the **same-origin** endpoint
   `/api/tracey/{projectId}/openai/v1` with the app's own JWT. The backend forwards to the
   project's provider and ingests the call. Tools are sent on the wire as JSON Schema (the SDK
   derives them from our zod schemas via `zodSchema`).
2. **Tool / data plane (browser).** When the model asks for a tool, the tool's `execute` handler
   runs **in the browser** and calls the existing typed `src/api/*.ts` services (same-origin, same
   JWT) or performs a client-side action (`navigate`, append a turn). The tool *result* is then
   rendered inline by the matching component in `components/tool-ui/` (mapped by tool name in
   `components/tool-ui/registry.ts`).

No upstream provider key ever reaches the browser. There is no short-lived key and no CORS —
everything is same-origin under the user's session.

## Single source of truth: tools live on the client

Tool **definitions live only here**, grouped by domain under `tools/*.ts`, each a zod schema +
`execute` handler. The backend does **not** mirror them: it captures Tracey's prompt + tools from
the wire and attributes the call to her agent by name (`X-Proxytrace-Agent` / same-origin tag). So:

- To add/change/remove a tool, edit the domain factory in `tools/` and the `TRACEY_TOOLS_META`
  list in `tracey-tools.ts` (for the slash menu). No C# tool schema to keep in sync.
- Tracey's **system prompt** lives only in `tracey-prompt.ts` (`TRACEY_SYSTEM_PROMPT`).
- Do **not** reintroduce a backend copy of the prompt or tools. The byte-identical-mirror
  constraint that used to exist is gone by design.

## File map

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `TraceyAI.tsx` | Page root. Consumes the shared chat via `useTraceyChatContext`, calls `activate()` on mount, renders status gates (no-project / loading / error / ready), lays out the chat panel with the conversation-history rail on the **right**. The rail is **collapsible and starts collapsed** (toggle in the chat panel header); the preference persists via `tracey-storage.ts` because this page unmounts on navigation. The one lazy-loaded route component. |
| `TraceyHost.tsx` | The single mount point for the chat: calls `useTraceyChat()` and wraps the routed page content in `TraceyChatProvider` + `TraceyActionsProvider` + `AssistantRuntimeProvider`. Rendered **once** by `Shell` around the router `Outlet`, and **lazy-loaded** so the whole Tracey stack (assistant-ui, ai SDK, tools, docs index) stays out of the main chunk. |
| `useTraceyChat.ts` | **The only stateful hook.** Owns the write-tool `confirm` seam (always-approve today), thread persistence, artifact lifecycle, the lazy session query, and builds the runtime. Called **once** from `TraceyHost` (above the router `Outlet`), not from the page — see "Conversation persistence". |
| `tracey-chat-context.ts` | Shares the single `TraceyChat` (runtime + state) app-wide. `TraceyChatProvider` mounts in `TraceyHost` around the `Outlet`; `useTraceyChatContext()` reads it from the page. |
| `tracey-runtime.ts` | `TraceyTransport` — the AI SDK `ChatTransport`. Wires `createOpenAI` at the same-origin base URL, injects the JWT + turn-correlation header per request, windows the history sent to the model (`windowMessages`, UI thread untouched), runs `streamText` with `prepareStep` (progressive tool disclosure) + `stopWhen: stepCountIs(MAX_TURN_STEPS)` (64 — a high infinite-loop **safety backstop**, not a user-facing turn limit), adapts our tools into the SDK `ToolSet` (threading the abort signal), and writes per-turn metadata on finish. |
| `tracey-tools.ts` | **Composition root** for tools: `createTraceyTools(ctx)` wires every `tools/*` domain factory against a shared artifact store. `TRACEY_TOOLS_META` is the static name+description list for the slash menu (must list every tool). |
| `tools/` | Per-domain tool factories: `navigation.ts` (navigate, search_docs, load_skill), `agents.ts`, `suites.ts`, `runs.ts`, `proposals.ts`, `stats.ts`, `providers.ts`, `traces.ts`, `display.ts` (show_*, ask_questions), `await.ts` (await_actions). `shared.ts` holds `TraceyToolContext`, the `tool()`/`empty`/`CANCELLED` helpers, and `makeStore`. `poll-until-terminal.ts` backs `await`; `run-analysis.ts` holds the pure failure/comparison derivations behind `get_run_failures`/`compare_runs` (verdicts reuse `features/runs/results.ts`). |
| `tool-access.ts` | **Progressive tool disclosure.** `CORE_TOOL_NAMES` (always active) + `activeToolNamesFor(loadedSkillIds)` (core ∪ the tool bundles of skills loaded this conversation). |
| `tracey-prompt.ts` | `TRACEY_SYSTEM_PROMPT` — her system prompt (wire source of truth), with the skill catalog appended. |
| `skills/` | On-demand **skills** — markdown playbooks loaded at runtime via `load_skill`. `registry.ts` parses front-matter (`name`, `description`, optional `tools:` bundle) from every `*.md` via `import.meta.glob`; `types.ts`; one file per skill. |
| `knowledge/` | Product-manual search for `search_docs`. `docs-index.generated.ts` is the build-time index of the VitePress manual; `search-docs.ts` does token-overlap ranking; `types.ts`. |
| `tracey-artifact-store.ts` | The browser **artifact store** (IndexedDB → localStorage fallback). Holds large tool payloads so only a compact reference + digest enters the model context; cards resolve the reference to render the full data. |
| `tracey-artifact-kinds.ts` | The **typed artifact contract**: `ArtifactPayloads` maps every artifact `kind` to its payload type. `StoreFn` only accepts the matching shape and `useArtifactResult(kind, …)` returns it (verifying the kind at runtime), so a tool and its card can't silently disagree (e.g. list-item DTO vs full DTO). |
| `tracey-artifacts.ts` | Frontend-only render shapes the `show_chart`/`show_table`/`show_text` tools return. |
| `tracey-storage.ts` | `localStorage` conversation-history persistence keyed by `user + project`: the conversation **index** (up to 20 metadata records + the active pointer), one **snapshot** blob per conversation, the rail-collapsed preference, `deriveConversationTitle`, and `migrateLegacyThread` (folds the pre-history single-thread blob into the model). |
| `components/TraceyConversationRail.tsx` | The conversation-history **right-hand rail** (collapsed by default). Lists stored conversations newest-first, highlights the active one, and offers new / open (view == continue) / delete (with a `ConfirmDialog`). Presentational — all state lives in `useTraceyChat`. |
| `tracey-actions.tsx` | React context (`navigate`) for assistant-ui message-part components that can't take props. |
| `tracey-quick-actions.ts` | Curated prompt presets: the empty-thread starter chips (clicking one **sends** its prompt immediately) + the top of the slash menu (which prefills for editing). |
| `useAskTracey.ts` | The app-wide **Ask Tracey** send queue: `askTracey(prompt)` navigates to the page, starts a fresh conversation, and appends the prompt once the session is `ready` (sends reject before that). Exposed on `TraceyChat`, consumed by `components/tracey/AskTraceyButton`. |
| `message-stats.ts` | `readMessageStats` + `readTraceConversationId` — narrows `metadata.custom` to tokens (input / cached-input / output / total) + duration + the trace id (unit-tested). |
| `useArtifact.ts` / `useOpenResponseTrace.ts` | Hook to resolve a stored artifact for a card; hook behind `OpenTraceButton`. |
| `TraceyConversation.tsx` | assistant-ui `Thread`/`Message` primitives styled to DESIGN.md: user/assistant bubbles, an end-of-thread "Thinking…" busy indicator while a turn runs, per-tool inline UI (`tools.by_name`) with `ToolCallCard` fallback, the `FollowUpSuggestions` chips after the last finished turn, empty state. |
| `follow-up-suggestions.ts` | Pure half of **follow-up suggestions**: the suggestion system/user prompts, `parseFollowUps` (tolerant JSON-array parse), and `latestExchange` (the trailing user→assistant text pair). Unit-tested (`*.spec.ts`); no React. |
| `useFollowUpSuggestions.ts` | Lifecycle hook: subscribes to the thread and, on each running→idle transition that ends in a *completed* assistant message with text, calls `TraceyTransport.generateFollowUps` and holds the result (tagged with the turn's message id). Aborts + clears the moment any new turn starts. |
| `components/FollowUpSuggestions.tsx` | The clickable follow-up chips (same anatomy as the starter `ToolChips`); reads `followUps` from the chat context, hides itself while running or once the thread moved past the tagged message, and **sends** a chip's text as a user message on click. |
| `components/` | `TraceyChatPanel`, `TraceyComposer` (Enter-to-send, `/` slash menu; its **send button toggles to a Stop button** via `ThreadPrimitive.If running` + `ComposerPrimitive.Cancel` while a turn runs — see "Stopping a turn"), `SlashMenu`, `ToolChips`, `ToolCallCard`, `AssistantMessage`/`UserMessage`, `MarkdownText`, `MessageStatusBar`, `CopyMessageButton`, `OpenTraceButton`, `artifacts/` renderers, and `tool-ui/` (one inline component per tool + `registry.ts`). |
| `api/tracey.ts` | `getSession()` → `{ model, agentId }` for `GET /api/tracey/session`. |

## How a turn flows

1. User sends a message (or picks a quick action / `/tool` from the composer).
2. `useChatRuntime` (assistant-ui over the AI SDK adapter) calls `DelegatingTransport.sendMessages`,
   which forwards to the live `TraceyTransport` once the session has resolved.
3. `TraceyTransport.sendMessages` mints one `crypto.randomUUID()` for the turn, sets it as the
   `x-proxytrace-conversation-id` header, and runs `streamText` against
   `/api/tracey/{projectId}/openai/v1/chat/completions` with the system prompt, the conversation,
   and the full tool set — but `prepareStep` restricts the **active** tools per step (see
   "Progressive tool disclosure").
4. If the model emits a tool call, the SDK runs that tool's `execute` **in the browser**;
   `stopWhen: stepCountIs(MAX_TURN_STEPS)` keeps the loop going (tool → result → model) until
   Tracey answers. **Without `stopWhen` the run ends after the first step and a tool-first turn
   produces no text** — don't remove it. `MAX_TURN_STEPS` (64) is only a high infinite-loop
   **safety backstop**, not a user-facing turn limit — a normal turn finishes well below it, and
   there is no "step limit reached" notice.
5. Results stream back; `TraceyConversation` renders assistant Markdown, per-tool inline UIs
   (`tools.by_name` → `tool-ui/registry.ts`), and the `ToolCallCard` fallback for the rest.
6. On the stream's **finish** part, `toUIMessageStream({ messageMetadata })` writes
   `metadata.custom = { traceConversationId, usage, durationMs }`, which drives `MessageStatusBar`.

## Follow-up suggestions (proactive next-message chips)

After every finished turn Tracey proposes two things the user might send next, rendered as animated
clickable chips under the last assistant message. Clicking one sends it as a user message.

- **When.** `useFollowUpSuggestions` subscribes to the thread and reacts to a **running→idle**
  transition whose last message is a `status.type === 'complete'` assistant message with text. A
  stopped/errored turn, the `ask_questions` pause (`requires-action`), and a tool-only answer (no
  text) all produce no suggestions. Because it keys off the live transition (not the message list),
  a **restored/reloaded conversation shows no chips** — they are in-memory only and never persisted.
- **How.** The producing call is `TraceyTransport.generateFollowUps` — one small `generateText`
  call (no tools, `maxOutputTokens` capped) over the same custom fetch as a turn, so it
  authenticates identically and, because `currentTurnId` is still set, is **ingested under the
  turn's ConversationId** (it groups with the turn's traces, and `OpenTraceButton` still resolves).
  The prompt/parse live in the pure `follow-up-suggestions.ts` (`parseFollowUps` tolerates code
  fences and drops non-strings / dupes / overlong entries, capped at `FOLLOW_UP_COUNT` = 2).
- **Removal is guaranteed two ways.** Starting any new turn (a user message, a chip click, a
  resubmit) aborts an in-flight generation and clears the state immediately; the render side
  additionally gates on the message id (`followUps.messageId === last message id`) and on
  `!isRunning`, so chips can never appear under anything but the exact turn they answer. A failed
  generation is swallowed — suggestions are a bonus, never an error.

## Stopping a turn (the cancel chain)

While a turn is running, `TraceyComposer`'s gold **Send** button is replaced by a neutral **Stop**
button (`ComposerPrimitive.Cancel`, gated by `ThreadPrimitive.If running` — the same `running`
signal that drives the "Thinking…" indicator). Pressing it cancels the run, and that one action
propagates the whole way down both planes:

- assistant-ui `cancel()` aborts the AI SDK run's `AbortController`. That signal arrives as
  `options.abortSignal` in `TraceyTransport.sendMessages`, where it is forwarded **both** to
  `streamText({ abortSignal })` (reasoning plane) **and** to every tool's `execute` via the SDK
  tool adapter (data plane — see `buildAiTools`).
- Aborting `streamText` aborts the underlying `fetch` to `/api/tracey/{projectId}/openai/v1`, which
  closes the connection. On the server, `TraceyChatController.Forward`'s action `CancellationToken`
  is `HttpContext.RequestAborted`; it is threaded into the upstream `client.SendAsync` and the
  SSE relay's `ReadLineAsync`, so the **upstream provider call is torn down** rather than left
  generating in the background. (A cancelled stream throws `OperationCanceledException` before the
  finish line, so a stopped turn is not ingested as a partial trace.)
- A long-running `await_actions` wait honors the same signal (abort-aware sleep + the poll GET's
  `signal`), so Stop ends the polling immediately instead of waiting out the 10-minute cap. The
  backend run/theory itself keeps going — only Tracey's *wait* is cancelled — so `AwaitActionsToolUI`
  renders a calm "Wait stopped" state (not a red error). It detects the stop two ways: assistant-ui
  sometimes finalizes the part as `incomplete/cancelled`, but a Stop that lands mid-`execute` leaves
  the aborted tool call **orphaned in `running`** (no terminal delta, no result), so the card also
  treats a still-`running` part as stopped once the thread itself is idle (`useThread(t => t.isRunning)`)
  — otherwise it would spin on "Waiting for N actions" forever.

## Progressive tool disclosure (skills gate tools)

The full tool set is large, so Tracey only ever *offers* a lean subset to the model on a given
step. Every tool is always **defined** in `createTraceyTools` (so a tool is one factory edit away
from reachable), but `tracey-runtime.ts`'s `prepareStep` sets `activeTools` to the core set plus the
bundles of every skill loaded **so far this conversation** (`tool-access.ts`). The AI SDK then
**filters the wire payload to the active subset** (`prepareToolsAndToolChoice`), so an unloaded
tool's schema never reaches the model — and a given call captures only the tools active for it
(CORE + loaded bundles), not the entire catalog:

- **`CORE_TOOL_NAMES`** are active on every step: `navigate`, `search_docs`, `load_skill`,
  `ask_questions`, the three `show_*` renderers, and the two universal agent reads (`list_agents`,
  `get_agent`).
- **Everything else is gated behind a skill.** A skill's front-matter `tools:` list is its
  *bundle*; loading the skill with `load_skill` unlocks that bundle for the **rest of the
  conversation**, not just the turn. At the start of each turn the transport re-derives the loaded
  set from the message history (`skillIdsFromMessages` — `load_skill` parts whose result wasn't
  `notFound`), unions it with the current turn's `load_skill` calls (`loadedSkillIds(steps)`), and
  mirrors it into `ctx.loadedSkillIds`. Because it comes from the messages, it survives a page
  reload and resets with the thread.
- **Repeat loads are no-ops.** `load_skill` checks `ctx.loadedSkillIds` and answers an
  already-loaded skill with a compact `{ alreadyLoaded: true }` instead of re-injecting the full
  playbook; the prompt tells the model a skill stays loaded and never to load it twice.

This gives a dispatcher feel without a second model: the lean core handles routing + simple
agent/doc questions; a request that needs suites, runs, proposals, stats, providers, traces, or any
write makes the model `load_skill` first, which then exposes that task's tools. The tests in
`tool-access.spec.ts` assert no defined tool is permanently unreachable (it must live in core or
some skill bundle).

## Tool catalog

`confirm: true` tools mutate state and route through the `confirm` write gate (below). The **Skill**
column is which bundle activates the tool (`core` = always available).

| Tool | Kind | Confirm | Skill | Inline UI |

| `await_actions` | wait | no | `test-suites-and-runs`, `optimize-agent`, `diagnose-agent` | `AwaitActionsToolUI` |

## Card density: reads render on demand (`present`)

A multi-step turn would otherwise stack a full card per read even though only the last is the
answer. So **the model decides what becomes a card.** Every gated read tool (`list_*`, `get_*`,
`find_traces`, the stats/analysis reads) carries an optional `present: boolean` arg (`presentArg`,
`tools/shared.ts`); it is purely presentational — `execute` ignores it, the digest the model
receives is identical. In the registry the read entries' cards are wrapped in
`presentGate(Card)` (`tool-ui/present-gate.tsx`): `present === true` renders the rich card,
otherwise the call collapses to the slim, expandable `ToolCallCard` trace row. So an intermediate
lookup stays a quiet one-liner and only the answer card shows. The decision logic (`isPresented`)
is unit-tested. The prompt's "card economy" rules tell the model to keep reads silent and set
`present: true` only when the card *is* the answer.

**Not gated (always render):** the explicit renderers (`show_*`), the live actions
(`start_test_run`, `submit_optimization_theory`), `await_actions`, `ask_questions`, and the suite
**writes** (`create_suite`/`add_to_suite`/`remove_test_case`) — a mutation result is a real event,
so `get_suite` is gated while those writes (same `SuiteCardToolUI`) are not. The gate is applied
per registry entry, so the same component is gated for a read yet full for a write.

## System agents hidden by default

Proxytrace runs internal **system agents** — Tracey herself and the evaluators (e.g. a helpfulness
judge) — flagged `isSystemAgent` on `AgentDto`/`AgentListItemDto` (and ephemeral A/B validation
**system runs**, `isSystemRun` on the run groups). They make real LLM calls, so without filtering
they'd show up in "list my agents", token-usage charts, "recent runs", and trace searches as noise.
So the read/search tools exclude them **by default**, and expose an `includeSystem` flag
(`includeSystemArg`, `tools/shared.ts`) the model sets only when the user explicitly asks about a
system agent (names Tracey or an evaluator, or says "system"/"internal"):

| Tool | Default | How it filters | `includeSystem: true` |
|------|---------|----------------|-----------------------|
| `list_agents` | hides system agents | client-side `!a.isSystemAgent` (digest **and** stored card) | lists them |
| `list_runs` | hides system A/B runs | `GET /api/test-runs?includeSystem=false` (backend drops runs of `IsSystemRun` groups) | lists them |
| `find_traces` | hides system-agent traces | passes `includeSystemAgents: false` (the backend default is **true**, so we send it explicitly) | includes them |
| `get_dashboard_stats` | excludes system agents from **all** figures | passes `excludeSystemAgents: true` to `GET /api/statistics/dashboard`; the backend drops system-agent calls from the summary, per-model, and per-agent aggregates (and the agents list), so totals aren't inflated by Tracey/evaluator activity | includes them |

Single-entity `get_*` by id (`get_agent`, `get_agent_stats`, `get_run`, `get_trace`) are **not**
gated — an id is already an explicit request; the model reaches a system agent's id by listing with
`includeSystem: true` first. The prompt (`tracey-prompt.ts`) and the `optimize-agent` /
`project-insights` / `test-suites-and-runs` skills carry the when-to-include nuance. The backend
filters mirror `/api/test-run-groups`' existing `includeSystem` (default false): runs via
`ITestRunRepository.GetByAgentPagedAsync` / `GetAllPagedAsync`, and stats via
`StatisticsFilter.ExcludeSystemAgents` applied at the `AgentCallStatsQueries.Query` chokepoint (so
every dashboard aggregate is filtered at once). The `/api/statistics/dashboard` and
`/api/test-runs` defaults are unchanged for every other caller — only Tracey opts in.

## Tools: read, write, render, wait, interactive

`TraceyToolContext` (`{ projectId, artifactScope, navigate, confirm }`, `tools/shared.ts`) is
built in `useTraceyChat` and passed to both `createTraceyTools` (for `execute`) and the SDK tool
adapter. Each domain factory also receives a `StoreFn` bound to the artifact store.

- **Read tools** (`list_*`, `get_*`, `get_*_stats`) call `src/api/*.ts`, push the full payload to
  the artifact store, and return only a compact digest + reference. `confirm: false`. They carry
  the optional `present` flag and are `presentGate`-wrapped (see "Card density") — silent by
  default, full card when the model opts in. The single-entity gets (`get_agent`, `get_run`,
  `get_proposal`, `get_provider`, `get_trace`, `get_suite`) each have a dedicated card in
  `tool-ui/`. Digests deliberately carry enough to
  answer follow-ups without more cards: list digests include the key row fields **but are capped**
  (`listDigest` in `tools/shared.ts` — first 20–25 rows + total count + a truncation note; the
  card always shows everything), and
  `get_dashboard_stats` includes `byAgent`/`byModel` usage breakdowns so a cross-agent usage chart
  needs one read, not `get_agent_stats` per agent (the prompt's "card economy" rules lean on
  this).
- **Write tools** (`start_test_run`, `cancel_test_run`, `set_proposal_status`,
  `submit_optimization_theory`, and the suite-curation writes `create_suite` / `add_to_suite` /
  `remove_test_case` / `update_expected_output`) set `confirm: true`. They call `ctx.confirm(summary)`
  **before** mutating; on decline they return the `CANCELLED` sentinel and never touch the mutating
  API. The curation writes that return a suite reuse `SuiteCardToolUI` (the same card as `get_suite`),
  resolving the stored `suite` artifact — they store the full updated suite and return only a compact
  digest, exactly like the read tools. Their results are digests too:
  `start_test_run` and `submit_optimization_theory` store the created entity as an artifact and
  return only identity fields + the `awaitable` handle (the theory in particular would otherwise
  echo the full proposed change the model just authored straight back into its context);
  `set_proposal_status` returns just `{ id, status }`.
- **Missing entities (404).** Every by-id lookup (reads and the write tools' pre-mutation
  lookups) passes `silentStatuses: [404]` and maps a 404 to a compact `{ notFound: id }` result
  (`ignore404`, `tools/shared.ts`) instead of throwing — no red error toast for a
  model-recoverable miss (stale id, deleted entity, run-vs-group id mix-up), and the model can
  re-list or ask instead of parsing an opaque error. `useArtifactResult` renders any inline
  `{ notFound }` as the card's error state, so cards need no per-card guard. `await_actions`
  polls with the same silence; a bad handle still lands in its per-handle `errors`.
- **Render tools** (`show_chart`, `show_table`, `show_text`) take the data as args and return only
  a stored render spec; the matching `tool-ui/` component draws it via a `components/artifacts/`
  renderer.
- **Wait tool** (`await_actions`) — see its own section below.
- **Interactive (human-in-the-loop) tools** (`ask_questions`) define **no `execute`**. The SDK
  emits the call and pauses; the tool-UI reads `args`, collects input, and calls `addResult(...)`
  to resolve the call. `useChatRuntime` is configured with
  `sendAutomaticallyWhen: lastAssistantMessageIsCompleteWithToolCalls`, so the runtime
  auto-resubmits and the model continues the **same** assistant turn with no extra user message.
  The result also drives the read-only summary, so it survives reload.

A tool gets inline UI by adding its component to `tool-ui/registry.ts` (keyed by tool name);
unmapped tools render with `ToolCallCard` (fine for `navigate`, `search_docs`,
`set_proposal_status`). `load_skill` is mapped to a hidden component (`HiddenToolUI`, renders
nothing) — it's plumbing, not something the user should see in the thread. Read-tool entries are
wrapped in `presentGate(Card)` so they render that card only when the model set `present: true`,
else the slim `ToolCallCard` (see "Card density"). The runtime's tool adapter omits `execute` for interactive tools so the
SDK treats them as frontend tools, and passes the SDK abort signal into `execute` so long-running
tools stop when the user stops the turn.

## The write gate: `confirm` (always auto-approve)

All write tools funnel through `useTraceyChat`'s `confirm(summary)`. Writes are **always
auto-approved**: `confirm` resolves `true` immediately and there is no user-facing toggle or
confirmation card. The seam is deliberately kept — every write still calls `ctx.confirm(...)`
before mutating and returns `CANCELLED` on `false` — so if a confirmation prompt is ever needed
again it goes back into the **tool layer** (not the model), where the model can't bypass it.

## The artifact store (keeping the model context lean)

Read/render tool results can be large (full DTOs, tables, traces). Putting them in the model
context would blow the budget and slow every step. So tools stash the full payload in the browser
**artifact store** (`tracey-artifact-store.ts`) and hand the model only a compact reference +
digest:

- `makeStore(ctx)` (`tools/shared.ts`) wraps `storeArtifact(scope, kind, full, summary)`. The
  model sees `summary` (counts, ids, key fields) plus a reference; the user sees the **full** data,
  because the inline card resolves the reference via `useArtifact` and renders it.
- Storage is **IndexedDB with a localStorage fallback**; if both are unavailable, `makeStore`
  swallows the error and returns the full payload inline — the card still renders, only that
  last-resort path costs model context.
- Artifacts are scoped by `artifactScope = "${userKey}:${projectKey}"`, **shared across that
  project's conversations** (artifact refs are globally unique, so there is no cross-conversation
  collision). Keeping the scope stable means the tool context / transport are not rebuilt when the
  user switches conversation. On mount, `useTraceyChat` prunes artifacts against the **union of
  every conversation's refs** (`collectArtifactRefs` over all snapshots → `pruneArtifacts`), **not**
  just the active thread's — an active-only prune would delete the other conversations' charts.
  Delete/eviction re-prunes against the remaining union. Pruning is mount/delete-only (never
  mid-stream, which could race a just-written blob). `clearArtifacts` is now used only for the
  (rare) full-scope wipe, **not** on the new-conversation path.

`await_actions` and `navigate` deliberately return inline (their results are already compact and
have no resolving card).

## Wait tool: `await_actions` (proactive long-running actions)

Test runs and optimization theories run for minutes on the backend. Rather than ending the turn and
making the user re-prompt, Tracey can **wait inside the same turn** and react when they finish:

- The producing write tools return an `awaitable: { kind, id }` handle in their digest
  (`start_test_run` → `{ kind: 'test-run', id }`, `submit_optimization_theory` →
  `{ kind: 'theory', id }`).
- The same-turn wait is **enforced, not just instructed**: `prepareStep` (`tracey-runtime.ts`)
  scans the turn's steps for `awaitable` handles no `await_actions` call has covered yet
  (`pendingAwaitables`) and, while any are pending, forces the next step with
  `toolChoice: { type: 'tool', toolName: 'await_actions' }`. The model can't end the turn with
  "the run has started" and leave the user to re-prompt for the outcome; it still authors the
  args, so it batches every pending handle into the one call. Cancelled / not-found writes return
  no handle and never force a wait; a wrong or missed id just re-forces on the next step, bounded
  by the `MAX_TURN_STEPS` safety backstop.
- Because the wait is forced right after any producing step, the prompts tell the model to start
  ALL the actions it intends to run in the **same step** (parallel tool calls), then call
  `await_actions` **once** with every handle (never per-action, never poll itself).
- `await.ts` polls each handle to a terminal state via `poll-until-terminal.ts` — runs:
  `Completed`/`Failed`/`Cancelled`; theories: `Validated`/`Invalidated` — at a 3 s interval with a
  **10-minute per-handle cap**. A capped handle returns `timedOut: true` rather than hanging.
- The poll **tolerates transient failures**: a wait makes up to ~200 GETs, so a single network
  blip / backend restart / 5xx must not void it. `pollUntilTerminal` retries and only gives up on
  a handle after `maxConsecutiveFailures` (3) *consecutive* failed polls — so a persistently bad
  id (404 every poll) still fails within ~10 s, while a finished run survives a mid-wait hiccup.
  An abort is never retried.
- It returns one compact aggregate (`{ results, errors?, anyTimedOut }`) with per-run pass/fail
  counts and per-theory resulting proposal id, so Tracey can summarize and act in the same turn.
  Failures are captured **per handle** (a bad id or persistent network error lands in `errors`),
  so one bad handle can't lose the other results. The tool description tells the model an
  `errors` entry means the state is *unknown* (the action may still be running), not that the
  action failed.
- The enforcement counts a handle as awaited only when the `await_actions` call **resolved**
  (`pendingAwaitables` reads the turn's `toolResults`, not `toolCalls`): a wait that errored
  (invalid input, unexpected throw) re-forces `await_actions` on the next step instead of letting
  the turn end without the outcome.
- A page reload mid-wait orphans the `await_actions` part (no result — the card shows "Wait
  stopped"). `convertToModelMessages(…, { ignoreIncompleteToolCalls: true })` in the transport
  drops such orphans from what the model sees; without it the orphaned tool-call has no matching
  tool result and the OpenAI-shape endpoint 400s **every** subsequent turn of that conversation.
- The wait honors the turn's **abort signal**: hitting Stop cancels the polling immediately
  instead of letting it run to the cap in the background (see "Stopping a turn"). The card then
  shows a neutral "Wait stopped" state — the backend run/theory keeps going regardless.
- `confirm: false`. Its inline card (`AwaitActionsToolUI`) shows one **live row per handle while
  waiting** — suite → agent + case progress for a run, the A/B phase for a theory — plus an
  elapsed stopwatch (`ElapsedStopwatch`, a leaf so the 1 s tick re-renders only the readout) and
  the `streaming-border` ring. The rows (`AwaitPendingRunRow` / `AwaitPendingTheoryRow`) are
  **passive mirrors of the query cache** (`useAwaitLiveStatus`, `enabled: false` +
  `throwOnError: false`): the producing live card in the same thread owns the fetch and patches
  the canonical key via SSE, so the rows never poll — polling here would double the tool's own
  3 s GETs, race stale responses against newer SSE patches, and (with the app-wide
  `throwOnError: true` default) let a bad handle crash the page. When done the card settles into
  one outcome row per action (`AwaitResultRow` — per-case counts, timed-out → warn;
  `AwaitErrorRow` — failed handle → danger) under a card-level verdict badge (`awaitOutcome` in
  `await-card-logic.ts`, unit-tested; a cancelled run is warn, never "all done"); the per-item
  **live** cards (`StartTestRunToolUI`, `TheoryToolUI`) still stream the detailed progress.

## Live cards (streaming write results)

Two write tools have cards that **stream** backend progress into the chat after the call returns,
patching the relevant query cache (never refetching — see DESIGN.md §8 / BEST_PRACTICES.md):

- **`StartTestRunToolUI`** → `LiveRunCard` via `useLiveTestRunGroup`: streams completion + pass/fail
  per case as the run executes; `live-run-progress.ts` derives the aggregate.
- **`TheoryToolUI`** → `LiveTheoryCard` via `useLiveTheory`/`useTheoryStream`: streams the A/B
  validation status into the `theory(id)` cache; `TheoryChangePreview` shows the proposed change.

## Per-response status row

Each finished assistant turn shows `MessageStatusBar` — a quiet row with the turn's **token usage
broken down into input / share-of-input-cached / output, plus duration**, a `CopyMessageButton`,
and an `OpenTraceButton`.

A Tracey turn is a multi-step tool loop, so it makes several upstream calls — each ingested as its
own trace, all sharing the turn's ConversationId. The SDK's `part.totalUsage` is the usage
aggregated **across all steps** (the whole turn), so it matches the sum of the turn's ingested
traces. We read tokens straight from the SDK at the client: instant, no polling.

- `TraceyTransport` writes `metadata.custom = { traceConversationId, usage, durationMs }` on the
  **finish** part only (so the row stays hidden while streaming); `usage` carries
  `inputTokens` / `cachedInputTokens` / `outputTokens` / `totalTokens` from `part.totalUsage`. The
  same turn id rides every upstream request as `x-proxytrace-conversation-id`, so the turn's calls
  share it.
- The backend (`TraceyChatController`) reads that header into `IngestMessage.ConversationId`, stored
  as each call's **`ConversationId`** (a GUID is stored verbatim; a non-GUID would be SHA-1 hashed).
  It leaves `SessionId` null on purpose, so a Tracey turn never creates a spurious debugging session.
- `MessageStatusBar` reads `metadata.custom` once; `message-stats.ts` narrows it to
  `{ inputTokens, cachedInputTokens, outputTokens, totalTokens, durationMs }` + the id; the row
  renders input / output via `fmtTokens` and the cached share via the shared `CachedTokensHint`
  primitive (`lib/format`'s `cachedPct`).
- `OpenTraceButton` → `useOpenResponseTrace` resolves the ConversationId to the latest call **on
  click** (one `GET /api/agent-calls`, not a poll) and routes to `/traces?focus=<id>` (expanding the
  turn's conversation group in Traces), or toasts if nothing is ingested yet. `CopyMessageButton`
  copies the assistant text (joined from the message's text parts).

## Conversation history & persistence

Tracey keeps a **history of up to 20 conversations per user+project** (the right-hand rail,
`TraceyConversationRail`). The user can start a new conversation, open a past one (view ==
continue — opening loads it as the active thread and they keep typing), and delete ones they no
longer want. It must all survive both in-app navigation and a full page reload. Three concerns:

1. **Across navigation (in-memory).** `useTraceyChat` builds the runtime, so whatever component
   calls it owns the runtime's lifetime. It is called **once in `TraceyHost`** — rendered by
   `Shell` above the router `Outlet` (lazy-loaded, so the Tracey stack stays out of the main
   chunk) — and shared through `TraceyChatProvider`. `TraceyHost` stays mounted while only the
   `Outlet` child swaps on navigation, so the runtime (and its messages) is never torn down when
   you leave and return to `/tracey-ai`. **Do not move the `useTraceyChat()` call back into
   `TraceyAI`** — the page unmounts on navigation, which is the exact bug this avoids.
The **model**, however, never sees the whole thread: `TraceyTransport` sends only the last
`MODEL_HISTORY_WINDOW` (30) messages per turn, cut at a user-message boundary (`windowMessages`),
so per-turn token cost stops growing with conversation age. The UI thread and the persisted
snapshot stay complete. The loaded-skill set is derived from the same window, so a playbook that
slid out of context counts as unloaded and a reload returns the full instructions again.

2. **Storage layout (localStorage, `tracey-storage.ts`).** Two key families per user+project:
   - `proxytrace.tracey.conversations:{user}:{project}` → the **index**:
     `{ version, activeId, items: ConversationMeta[] }` (`items` capped at `MAX_CONVERSATIONS` = 20).
   - `proxytrace.tracey.conversation:{user}:{project}:{id}` → one `ConversationSnapshot` per
     conversation: `{ headId, messages: [{ parentId, message: UIMessage }] }` — the AI SDK's
     **native message format**, round-tripped through the runtime's `exportExternalState()` /
     `importExternalState()`.

   **Never persist `thread.export()` / restore with `thread.import()`.** Those carry assistant-ui
   `ThreadMessage`s whose link back to the underlying AI SDK `UIMessage`s is a **Symbol-keyed
   property that `JSON.stringify` drops**; importing a JSON round-tripped export "succeeds" but the
   runtime's `onImport` finds no inner messages, rebuilds the chat state as `[]`, and the thread
   renders empty — the history rail looks like clicking does nothing. `importExternalState`
   converts stored `UIMessage`s back through the AI SDK converter, which rebinds them properly.
   `isRestorableSnapshot` guards restores: a legacy (pre-fix, `content`-shaped) snapshot is skipped
   and the thread starts fresh instead of showing blank messages.

   Snapshots stay in localStorage (large tool payloads already live in the IndexedDB artifact
   store, so a snapshot is just message text + compact digests). `saveConversationSnapshot` returns
   `false` on a quota throw so `persist` can evict the oldest conversation and retry once.

3. **The runtime layer (`useTraceyChat`).** One assistant-ui thread is live at a time; the hook
   owns which conversation it holds. Key rules — get these wrong and you corrupt history:
   - The **id is minted lazily** on the first persisted message (an untouched "new conversation"
     never creates a ghost entry). The **title** is derived from the first user message
     (`deriveConversationTitle`, empty fallback localized by the rail); `persist` bumps `updatedAt`
     each change but only `setState`s the rail on a structural change (new/evict), not per token.
   - `persist` keys off `activeIdRef.current`, guarded by `restoringRef` so the transient
     empty-thread / import notifications during a thread swap can't clobber a stored snapshot with
     an empty export.
   - **Switching conversations:** `await runtime.threads.switchToNewThread()` **before**
     `thread.importExternalState(snapshot)` — right after a switch the binding can transiently
     resolve to the empty core, whose import throws. (When the current thread is already the fresh
     "new" one, `switchToNewThread` resolves as a no-op and the import lands in it — fine.)
   - **"New conversation" archives, it does not destroy.** The current conversation is already
     persisted under its id, so `startNewConversation` just detaches the active pointer and switches
     to a fresh thread. It must **not** call `clearArtifacts` (that would wipe every conversation's
     artifacts under the shared scope).
   - Display state (`conversations` / `activeConversationId`) is read from localStorage with the
     **render-time re-read pattern** (keyed on `{user}:{project}`, like `useTraceFilters`), because
     pages don't remount on a project switch.
   - A pre-history single-thread blob is folded in once by `migrateLegacyThread` (idempotent).
   - Restore is pure localStorage + `importExternalState` — it must **not** depend on the session/JWT (which is
     in-memory-only and gone after a reload); a continued conversation renders instantly and its
     first *new* turn waits for the session exactly as a fresh chat does.

Because the runtime mounts app-wide, the **session** is provisioned lazily: the session query has
backend side effects (Tracey agent provisioning), so it only fires once the page calls `activate()`
on mount. The flag latches on, so the session stays alive across navigation; pages the user never
opens Tracey from provision nothing. The query uses `throwOnError: false` so a failed session can't
bubble to an ErrorBoundary and crash the shell — it surfaces as the contained "error" state on the
page. The session is also gated on `useKiosk().interactive`, since Tracey makes real LLM calls and
is unavailable in non-interactive kiosk mode.

## Ask Tracey entry points (context-aware buttons)

Pages deep-link *into* Tracey via `TraceyChat.askTracey(prompt)`:
`components/tracey/AskTraceyButton.tsx` (gold pill, glinting `ZapFilledIcon`, hidden when
`TraceyChat.available` is false — Free license / non-interactive kiosk / no project) calls it with
a prompt built by the pure builders in `components/tracey/askTraceyPrompts.ts` (unit-tested).
`askTracey` archives the current conversation (`startFreshThread`), navigates to `/tracey-ai`,
`activate()`s the session, and queues the prompt in `useAskTracey.ts` until `status === 'ready'`
(the transport rejects sends before the session resolves; an `error` status drops the queued
prompt). Current placements: trace drawer header (anomaly-aware — includes outlier flags +
detector hits), agent header (pass-rate-aware), run group header (failure-aware), theory drawer,
anomalies page, dashboard. The prompts carry real entity ids and end with an "ids come from the
app UI" note that matches the app-provided-ids exception in `TRACEY_SYSTEM_PROMPT` — do not
remove one without the other. Prompts stay untranslated (like `tracey-quick-actions.ts`).

## Skills (on-demand playbooks + tool bundles)

A **skill** is a named markdown playbook the model loads at runtime instead of carrying in the base
prompt. The system prompt advertises only a compact catalog (`name — description`, built by
`skillCatalog()`); the body arrives as the `load_skill` tool result when the model decides a task
matches, **and** loading it unlocks that skill's tool bundle for the rest of the turn (see
"Progressive tool disclosure"). This keeps `TRACEY_SYSTEM_PROMPT` lean and the per-step tool list
sharp as the catalog grows.

Current skills (`skills/*.md`):

| Skill (`name`) | Unlocks (`tools:`) |
|----------------|--------------------|
| `test-suites-and-runs` | `list_suites`, `get_suite`, `list_runs`, `get_run`, `get_run_failures`, `compare_runs`, `start_test_run`, `cancel_test_run`, `await_actions` |
| `suite-curation` | `list_suites`, `get_suite`, `find_traces`, `get_trace`, `create_suite`, `add_to_suite`, `remove_test_case`, `update_expected_output` |
| `review-proposals` | `list_proposals`, `get_proposal`, `set_proposal_status` |
| `project-insights` | `get_dashboard_stats`, `get_provider`, `find_traces`, `get_trace` |
| `optimize-agent` | `submit_optimization_theory`, `get_agent_stats`, `list_suites`, `list_runs`, `get_run`, `get_run_failures`, `compare_runs`, `find_traces`, `get_trace`, `list_theories`, `await_actions` |
| `diagnose-agent` | `get_agent_anomalies`, `get_trace`, `find_traces`, `list_suites`, `get_suite`, `create_suite`, `add_to_suite`, `update_expected_output`, `list_evaluators`, `create_evaluator`, `start_test_run`, `list_runs`, `get_run`, `get_run_failures`, `list_theories`, `submit_optimization_theory`, `await_actions` |

- **Add a skill:** drop a `skills/<name>.md` with YAML front-matter (`name`, `description`, optional
  `tools:` — a comma/space-separated bundle) and the playbook as the body. `registry.ts`
  `import.meta.glob`s every `*.md` and parses the front-matter — no registration code, no prompt
  edit, no backend change. It's auto-listed in the catalog and loadable, and its `tools:` are
  auto-gated.
- **`load_skill`** (core tool, no confirm) returns `{ name, instructions }`,
  `{ name, alreadyLoaded, note }` for a skill already loaded this conversation (the playbook is
  not re-injected), or `{ notFound, available }` for an unknown id.
- The **`optimize-agent`** skill drives `submit_optimization_theory`: verify the agent + its suite,
  ground a hypothesis in real run/trace evidence, author one change, submit it. The submit tool
  posts to `POST /api/theories` (`source: TraceyAi`); the backend A/B-validates it and either spawns
  a Draft proposal or invalidates it. `TheoryToolUI` → `LiveTheoryCard` streams that status.
- The **`diagnose-agent`** skill starts from `get_agent_anomalies` (the agent's outlier-flagged
  calls — `outlierOnly=true` list, flag bits decoded into reasons in the digest), analyzes the
  flagged traces, then turns the problem into test cases: add to a fitting suite, or create a new
  anomaly suite with a matching evaluator (`list_evaluators` / `create_evaluator` +
  `create_suite`'s `evaluatorIds`; an unlicensed Agentic create returns `notLicensed` and the
  playbook falls back to the default exact-match evaluator). It then runs the suite and finishes
  through the same theory → A/B path as `optimize-agent`.

## Product-manual search (`search_docs`)

`search_docs` answers how-to / what-is / setup / conceptual questions about Proxytrace **itself**
(not the user's data). It searches a build-time index of the VitePress manual:

- `knowledge/docs-index.generated.ts` is the generated index (one entry per manual section, with
  its `/docs/...` `url`). `search-docs.ts` tokenizes the query and ranks sections by token overlap,
  returning short snippets.
- The system prompt makes the read/answer split sharp — data tools for the user's agents/runs/stats,
  `search_docs` for how the product works — and **requires citing** the returned `url` as an inline
  markdown link, never inventing a docs URL.

## Building an inline tool UI (agentic card)

This is the heart of the "Tracey shows, doesn't narrate" design. A tool gets a rich inline
component by mapping its name to a `ToolCallMessagePartComponent` in `components/tool-ui/registry.ts`.
assistant-ui renders that component in place of the `ToolCallCard` fallback.

### What the component receives

Each `tool-ui/` component is a `ToolCallMessagePartComponent`, handed the live state of the call:

- `result` — what the tool's `execute` returned (`undefined` until it resolves) — typically the
  digest + an artifact reference. Use this for **read** and **render** tools; resolve the reference
  with `useArtifact` to get the full payload.
- `args` — the model's arguments. Use this for **interactive** tools. **It streams**: during
  generation fields may be missing, so guard before reading (`if (!args.options) …`).
- `status` (`{ type }`), `isError` — execution lifecycle.
- `addResult` — for human-in-the-loop tools: call it with the collected input to resolve the paused
  call and continue the turn.

### The three-state pattern

Resolve the part into one of three states and render through the shared chrome:

```tsx
const state = toolUiState(status, isError, result != null); // 'pending' | 'error' | 'ready'
```

`ToolUIFrame` (`tool-ui/ToolUIFrame.tsx`) draws the card chrome and handles `pending` (spinner +
label) and `error` (danger line) uniformly, so a component only writes its *ready* content.
`toolUiState` lives in `tool-ui/tool-ui-state.ts` (a non-component file — never export a helper from
a `.tsx` that also exports a component, or you break the fast-refresh lint rule).

### Three recipes

1. **Entity card (navigable).** Resolve `result` to the DTO, derive a per-entity color from
   `lib/colors`, and wrap in `EntityCardLink` — it renders `ToolUIFrame` inside a real
   React-Router `<Link>`, so the whole card is keyboard-focusable and opens the entity's page.
   Build `to` from the deep-link conventions:

   | Entity | Route |
   |--------|-------|
   | Agent | `/agents?id=<id>` |
   | Run | `/runs?run=<id>` |
   | Proposal | `/proposals?agentId=<agentId>` |
   | Trace | `/traces?focus=<id>` |
   | Provider | `/providers` |

2. **Render spec.** Have `execute` return a plain data spec (e.g. `show_chart` →
   `{ kind, title, chartType, points }`) and render it through `ToolUIFrame` + an existing renderer
   in `components/artifacts/`. Don't recompute SVG/markdown — reuse the renderer.

3. **Interactive (human-in-the-loop).** Give the tool **no `execute`** so the SDK pauses. Read
   `args` (guard for partial streaming), collect input in local `useState`, and call `addResult(...)`
   to resolve the paused call. Drive the "done"/read-only state off the `result` prop so it survives
   reload. See `AskQuestionsToolUI` (pure logic in `ask-questions-logic.ts`).

### Card rules (DESIGN.md + BEST_PRACTICES.md)

- **Reuse primitives** — `Card`, `Pill`, `Badge`, `StatusDot`, `FormField`, `Button`, `CodeBlock`,
  `DataTable`. Never hand-roll a card/button/pill.
- **Clickable = real `<Link>`/`<button>`.** Never `<div onClick>`. Entity cards use `EntityCardLink`;
  interactive controls use `Button`.
- **Color by data, not string-through-props.** Per-entity hues come from `agentColor`/`modelColor`/
  `providerColor` in `lib/colors`; semantic status uses a `Badge` *variant*
  (`success`/`warn`/`danger`/`neutral`).
- **Tokens only.** No raw hex/px/shadow; inline `style` only for a runtime color from `lib/colors`.
  No `any`, `as any`, or `!`.
- **`data-testid`** on the card root (`tracey-<thing>-card`) and every interactive control.
- **One component per file, ≤ 300 lines.** Shared chrome/helpers go in `ToolUIFrame.tsx` /
  `EntityCardLink.tsx` / `tool-ui-state.ts`, not duplicated per card.

## Adding or changing a tool (checklist)

1. Add/edit the entry in the matching `tools/*.ts` factory: `description`, `parameters` (zod),
   `confirm`, `execute`. Reuse an existing `src/api/*.ts` service in `execute` — don't add a bespoke
   fetch. For read/render tools, push the full payload through the `store` and return a compact
   digest (+ a reference, + an `awaitable` handle if it's a long-running write).
2. Add/update its entry in `TRACEY_TOOLS_META` (`tracey-tools.ts`) so it appears in the slash menu.
3. **Disclosure:** unless it belongs in `CORE_TOOL_NAMES`, add the tool name to a skill's `tools:`
   bundle in `skills/<skill>.md` — otherwise it's defined but never offered to the model.
4. If it's a write, set `confirm: true` and gate the mutation behind `ctx.confirm(...)`, returning
   `CANCELLED` when declined.
5. If it should render custom inline UI, add a component to `components/tool-ui/` and map it in
   `components/tool-ui/registry.ts` (keyed by the tool name); have `execute` return the data the
   component reads from `result`.
6. If the tool changes what Tracey can do, update `TRACEY_SYSTEM_PROMPT` (and/or the relevant skill
   body) so she knows about it and when to reach for it.
7. No backend change is required for the tool contract — attribution is by name, and the captured
   version records whatever tools go over the wire.

## Constraints & gotchas

- **`stopWhen` is mandatory** (turn step 4). It's the difference between a working agent loop and
  silent tool-first turns.
- **`prepareStep` is mandatory too** — without it the model sees the full tool set every step,
  defeating disclosure. Keep `CORE_TOOL_NAMES` lean.
- **A defined-but-ungated tool is dead.** If a new tool is neither core nor in any skill bundle, the
  model can never call it. `tool-access.spec.ts` guards this.
- **Reasoning models send the system prompt under the `developer` role**, not `system`. A backend
  parser concern, but be aware her calls may look different on the wire.
- Hooks can't be conditional, so the runtime is created once with a `DelegatingTransport` and the
  real transport is swapped in after the session query resolves.
- All Tracey state lives in `useTraceyChat`; conversation and `tool-ui/` components stay
  presentational. Data fetching goes through TanStack Query — no raw `useEffect`/`fetch`.
- Styling follows DESIGN.md tokens, including the restyled assistant-ui primitives. The chat is
  the scoped **Tracey assistant tier** (DESIGN.md §8.2): prose renders at the reading tier
  (`text-chat`, via `components/chat-markdown.tsx`), and the halo / aurora / gradient-text /
  thinking-shimmer classes are Tracey-only. File-size and
  component rules from BEST_PRACTICES.md apply — split tool UIs into `components/` if a file
  approaches the cap.

## Keep the manual in sync

User-facing behavior is documented in [`../../manual/guide/tracey.md`](../../manual/guide/tracey.md).
Per `CLAUDE.md`, a Tracey feature change isn't complete until that page matches.
