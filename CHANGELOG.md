# Changelog

All notable, user-facing changes to Proxytrace are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and versions
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). Ongoing work is collected under
`[Unreleased]`; cutting a release moves that section under the new version heading
(see `docs/releasing.md`).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Faster initial load** — the Tracey AI chat stack now loads in its own lazy chunk,
  halving the main JavaScript bundle (gzip 477 kB → 251 kB) and speeding up first paint
  on every page. Tracey's bundled manual-search index is also fetched on demand instead
  of shipping with her tools.

### Security

- **Local-mode sessions now use an httpOnly cookie.** The session token is no longer
  persisted in browser `localStorage` (where any injected script could read it); the
  backend issues it as an `HttpOnly`/`SameSite=Strict` cookie and clears it on the new
  logout endpoint. API clients keep using the `Authorization` header unchanged.

### Fixed

- The sidebar showed a hardcoded "v0.1 · alpha" label; it now shows the actual
  installed release version.
- **Settings → Danger zone:** "Delete all non-model data" left the dashboard and other
  views showing stale pre-wipe numbers until a manual refresh.
- Signing out now lands on a real `/login` URL instead of an undefined route.

## [1.0.0-rc.1] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Brand mark** — new "Scope" logo and app icons: a gold trace pulse over an
  oscilloscope graticule with a teal live cursor.
- **Trace capture** — OpenAI-compatible ingestion proxy that records every LLM
  interaction (requests, responses, tool calls, token usage, cost, latency) with
  zero agent code changes.
- **Projects, agents & API keys** — organize captured traffic per project and agent,
  authenticated with per-agent proxy API keys.
- **First-run setup wizard** — guided onboarding (provider → model → project) ending in
  per-language quick-start examples (Python, TypeScript, C#, curl); clients keep their
  upstream provider API key and swap only the base URL.
- **Dashboard & statistics** — live telemetry, token/cost breakdowns, latency and
  pass-rate trends per agent, model, and project.
- **Test suites & evaluators** — curate captured traces into benchmark suites and
  judge them with configurable evaluators (including agentic and custom evaluators).
- **Test runs** — execute suites against any model endpoint with a live, streaming
  results view and per-evaluator progress.
- **Optimization loop** — data-driven optimization theories, A/B validation runs,
  and reviewable improvement proposals.
- **Tracey** — built-in AI assistant with access to your traces and the manual.
- **Authentication** — local accounts or OIDC single sign-on (Enterprise).
- **Licensing** — Free tier built in; Enterprise features unlocked with a license key.
- **Self-hosted deployment** — versioned container images on GHCR with a downloadable
  Docker Compose artifact; database migrations apply automatically on upgrade.
- **Update notifications** — daily check against the public release feed; admins see a
  dismissible in-app notice when a newer version is available (opt-out via `Updates:Enabled`).
- **User & operator manual** — bundled at `/docs`, searchable, with admin guides.
